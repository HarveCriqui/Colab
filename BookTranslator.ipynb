game.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>- You\\'re still playing?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I turned my gaze to the game filling up the computer screen.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yeah.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>- I got bored and quit a long time ago.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Is it really that fun?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yeah, it is.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>- Look at you, talking like that.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Why are you so nonchalant?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I couldn\\'t help but burst into dry laughter at the sound of Yong-ho\\'s voice coming through the phone.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Thanks for the game, hyung.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>- Ugh.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Goosebumps.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I shouldn\\'t have done that.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Don\\'t say things like that again.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Then, Yong-ho suddenly brought up an old story.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>- It\\'s been four years since you entered society, right?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"....\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>- The difficult times are over.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Now, go out, meet some girls, and enjoy yourself.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I\\'ll try my best.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>-Tsk.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I know it won\\'t go as you want it to.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But our motto was always about turning the impossible into possible, right?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It\\'s already been four years.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The military organization I was a part of disbanded due to an unexpected event.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, it was a good thing.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was something to be happy about.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But because it happened so suddenly, I still couldn\\'t grasp the situation.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I thought reunification with North Korea only happened in novels.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, only the unit I was in disbanded, and other units were still active.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The unit I was in disappeared quickly because it wouldn\\'t be good if it became known.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After organizing my thoughts for a moment, I opened the refrigerator to fill my stomach.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Then, let\\'s meet up sometime.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>- Oh, that\\'s great!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Let\\'s meet this weekend.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I\\'ll come to your place.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After ending the call, I lightly threw my phone onto the bed.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Yong-ho, who I just talked to on the phone, was a fellow soldier from the same unit as me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>He was discharged earlier than me due to an accident, but now he\\'s working fine at a company.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I stared at the freezer for a while, but in the end, I took out a frozen food item.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>When I was in the military, even my diet was managed, so I never thought I would be able to eat something like this again.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Being in a strictly controlled and managed unit caused me to have a strong aftereffect from the sudden discharge.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Because of that, I couldn\\'t adapt to society.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, I had enough money from the salary I saved up and the compensation I received from the forced discharge.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As a result, I became a well-off misfit, going here and there, but with Yong-ho\\'s help, I was able to improve a lot.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Ding!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The quickly heated frozen dumplings emitted steam.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I moved the dumplings to the desk and sat back down in my seat.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Peccata.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That\\'s the name of the game currently displayed on the screen.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After being discharged, I was in such a serious state that not even Yong-ho could do anything for me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>During that time, I tried various things for two years, saying that I\\'m removing the military from my life, but problems always arose.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I owe a lot to Yong-ho hyung.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>During that time, Yong-ho hyung coincidentally brought a game CD.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Following his advice to take it easy and clear my mind first, I tried playing the game.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The graphics were bad, but the high degree of freedom, numerous branching paths, and various playable characters quickly drew me into the game.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Since I had never played a game before in my life, I had no sense for it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But I kept playing and eventually cleared it in a year.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The feeling of emptiness, wondering if this was the end, quickly disappeared.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Because the number of playable characters continued to increase as I cleared the game.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And the unlocked characters started with much worse conditions than before.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>[Tarman (Martial Artist)]</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Even the character I just cleared was of an unprecedented difficulty level.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I was frustrated, having repeated the cycle of life and death more than 10 times, even with my experience of clearing the game.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Sometimes, if I liked the character I had cleared, I would play a little longer, but not this time.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As I took a bite of dumplings, I tried to check the newly unlocked character.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nDududududu.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Who is it?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nToday, the phone kept ringing.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>There was no one who would call me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I checked the number and it showed \"caller ID restricted\".</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>A mysterious tension ran down my spine, and I hesitated on whether to answer or not.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Although it has been disbanded now, the unit I belonged to was an extremely confidential unit with no room for mistakes.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Honestly, it was surprising that the government just let us go.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Should I be grateful that they didn\\'t silence us by killing us?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Because of this, whenever I saw a caller ID restriction, I couldn\\'t help but feel nervous.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nClick.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThe call ended.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nWithout realizing it, a sigh escaped my lips.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nDududududu.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAnd as if mocking my sigh, the phone rang again.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIn the end, I decided to answer and immediately pressed the call button.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Hello.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n- Ah, ah.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Can you hear me?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Who is this?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n- Can you hear me?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"I can hear you.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Who is this?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAlthough the voice sounded playful, it was hard to tell the gender.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIt sounded like a distorted voice.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n- Ah!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I am the developer of Peccata.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nPeccata?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI wondered what that meant, but as soon as he mentioned the developer, I remembered the game I was playing.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Sin?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n- Yes!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That\\'s right.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nHe chuckled and continued.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n- Anyway, I checked and it turns out that Mr. Kim Jin-hwan has cleared the game a whopping 12 times.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Thank you for enjoying our game so much and congratulations.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nMy breath stopped when my name came out of his mouth.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nEven if it\\'s the game, how does he know my name?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIt was Yong-ho hyung who brought the game CD.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nDid Yong-ho hyung tell him?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>No, that\\'s impossible.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"How do you know my name?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n- Um, let\\'s put that aside for now and let me explain the special benefits.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"I\\'m asking you how you know my name.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Answer me.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n- Well, first of all, we will give Mr. Kim Jin-hwan a more realistic gameplay experience.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And in addition, in the next round, we will give you two special abilities.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>One is random as always, and the second is the opportunity to choose.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>How about it?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Isn\\'t it great?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAs soon as I heard that, I immediately hung up the phone.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAnd I called Yong-ho hyung.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n- The phone is turned off, beep...</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAlthough I had just made a call earlier, it didn\\'t connect.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI compulsively opened the closet and packed my things.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAn ominous feeling kept piercing through my mind.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"I have to change my location first.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>They might have tracked my location...</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>No, they might have known my location from the beginning.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAfter packing my things roughly, as I was about to go out, I saw the computer screen that was turned on.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Just in case, I should format the computer too.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI sat in front of the desk for a moment and tried to turn off the game when I looked at the screen.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n[Playable Character: Kim Jin-hwan (Adrias Cromwell)]</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nWhat is this?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nWhy is my name on the game screen?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nBefore I could finish that thought, the screen gradually turned black, as if it was turning into a sticky liquid.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nBefore I could even try to avoid that supernatural phenomenon, my mind turned black just like the screen.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Adrias!\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nWith a sharp shout, an empty flask flew towards me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI effortlessly caught the flying bottle and calmly looked at Silbeck.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"I clearly told you to organize \\'The Contradiction between Nature and Mana\\' and put it on the desk today!\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI cautiously nodded my

<p>\\nWell, that\\'s because I don\\'t even know what magic is, let alone mana.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nOf course, I didn\\'t say that out loud.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nWithout saying a word, I just stood there, and Silbeck\\'s face turned red with anger.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Go out right now and bring it to me!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Hurry!\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIn response to his anger, I\\nI left the office without looking back.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As I stepped outside, I could feel the gazes of numerous students passing by in the hallway.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"What are you looking at?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Have you never seen someone before?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nOops.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I said what I was thinking out loud.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It seems like my impulsive nature has influenced my personality.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nFortunately, those who heard my words just gave me pitiful looks without any objections and went on their way.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I had more important things to prioritize than those looks, so I headed towards the library.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAs I stepped outside the building, I saw a wide open space with architectural styles reminiscent of the medieval era.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And above all, I noticed a towering tower that seemed to pierce through the sky, and three huge moons filling the sky.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n*Ding!*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"There are unselected attributes.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThe Korean characters that I

a language they can\\'t understand, Korean.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI let out a deep sigh.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIt\\'s been a week since I came here.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI was sure I was going to format my computer, but when I woke up, I realized that I wasn\\'t myself anymore.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I had become Adrian Cromwell, not Kim Jin-ho.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIt was confusing, but I hid my emotions.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThe more crisis I faced, the more I practiced hiding my emotions.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI should consider myself lucky, I had some memories of being Adrian.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nOf course, I didn\\'t know his entire life, but I was able to grasp where this place was.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nRecalling it, this place was a world of \"sin\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>called \"Peccata.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAdrian\\'s memories were no different from the game world of \"Peccata.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAnd as I reviewed Adrian\\'s memories during this week, it became even more certain.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI am currently inside the game world.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"I want to find a book.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"What kind of book?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"\\'Conflicting Understanding of Nature and Mana.\\'\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Magic-related books

money off me?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI shook my head.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nLately, thoughts that I wouldn\\'t normally have have been popping up in my head.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIt seems like Adrian\\'s influence is quite significant.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Of all characters....\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAmong the many characters, it had to be this guy.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI never even raised this guy in the first place.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAfter the law enforcer Tarmund, I raised him last.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"But still...</p>\\n

  <br/>\\n    <p>\\nHe was a character that could be considered worthless for the player, to the point that he could be seen as experience points for the player.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThe problem lies with his mentor.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nNo, should I even call that guy his mentor?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"I found it.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nWhile lost in thought, I finally found the book I was looking for.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nLuckily, it was arranged in alphabetical order, so I found it quickly.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI immediately opened the book.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"...Interesting.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIt was different from the game.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIn the game, I had raised three mage characters.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nBut the contents of this book were about capturing clouds in the sky.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIn reality, it wasn\\'t as simple as just learning a skill and using it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nMagic had to be activated through a complex and intricate process using mana, just like the contents of this book.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Of course, this is just a theoretical book.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI sighed inwardly and took the book with me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI didn\\'t plan on organizing the book, but I had to act in a way that wouldn\\'t arouse suspicion.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAs I walked back, carrying the book, I once again thought about myself, about Adrian.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI, who had no sense in the game, knew about all the characters through note-taking.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAt first, this guy dies quickly in the early stages of the game.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI didn\\'t kill all the playable

posture, the girl exuded an aura that seemed to come naturally, rather than being forced.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In fact, she was blossoming into a beautiful woman, making it difficult to still call her a girl.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nWith each step she took, her dark hair fluttered, capturing the attention of those around her.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\n\"That\\'s Dienne Yang.</p>\\n

about her background?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAs Dienne calmly and confidently walked forward, ignoring the surrounding chatter, she suddenly noticed someone.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nAt first, she thought she had seen wrong and tried to ignore it, but she soon realized that her eyes weren\\'t mistaken and stopped in her tracks.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\n\"Adrias Cromwell.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThe eldest son of the Cromwell Viscount.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Well, he can\\'t be called a viscount anymore.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>He\\'ll probably be demoted soon.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nThe reason she looked at him, despite his lowly status, was not for any other reason.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>His family owed a debt to her family.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nThat\\'s why they had crossed paths several times since they were young, and they had even been somewhat friendly.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\n\"It was different when we were ignorant children.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nBut now, they were just creditor and debtor.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Ever since the previous Viscount Cromwell died two years ago, Adrias had shown nothing but deference whenever he saw her.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>He was like a bug.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nHe had no talent, no abilities, and he didn\\'t even make an effort.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>He simply existed because he was born, a worthless creature that didn\\'t even bother to hide his pathetic appearance for a moment of peace.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nBut...</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\n\"Why?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nSomething was different today.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>His usual disheveled hair and foolish face were the same as always.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nBut it wasn\\'t his usual slouched posture, and his perpetually gloomy expression seemed filled with a strange sense of melancholy.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nOf course, she had seen him with a troubled expression before, but this was different from what she had seen in the past.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nSuddenly, her gaze fell on the book he was holding.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\n\"Conflicting Understanding of Nature and Mana?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIt was a book she had already mastered.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It wasn\\'t a book that such a worthless person could understand.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>There must be some errand or some other reason for him to have it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nThe Adrias she knew was that kind of person.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\n\"Hmm?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAs if sensing her gaze, he snapped out of his thoughts and looked in her direction.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\n\"....\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAfter a moment, he slightly bowed his head and continued on his way.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\n...He just continued on his way?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nTrying to act natural, she turned around to look, and he really was just walking away.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\n\"Huh?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAn involuntary exclamation escaped her lips.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The fact that she made a sound was a blow to her pride.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\n\"Adrias, right?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nHe seemed like a completely different person.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nFrom a distance, she had been unsure, but seeing him up close, the atmosphere was different.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nDid Adrias, who used to just greet her and pass by, really just pass by without a word?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\n\"Weird.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nRather than getting angry, curiosity and doubt surged within her like waves.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nShe had thought he was a worthless bug.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nBut something must have happened during all this time.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n

lingering gazes, I quickened my pace.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I didn\\'t want to get involved with whoever was staring at me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nDienne Alben.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The prodigy of the Alben Duke, and one of the most talented mages.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nShe was also a character I had played in the game and now, as the owner of this body, the closest playable character to Adrias.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nThat meant she was the most likely one to kill me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\n\"But seeing her alive and breathing like this gives me a fresh perspective.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAs the game progressed, the characters became more pitiful, and the difficulty increased due to the nature of the game.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Characters like Dienne Alben, with high specs, were meant for beginners.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nI remember choosing her as my third character, and her talent and her family\\'s power couldn\\'t be ignored.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The Alven Duke\\'s family boasted such immense power that they were referred to as one of the four pillars supporting the empire.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Come to think of it, I also owe them a debt.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nA painful memory suddenly came to mind.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThe shame and inferiority complex that this weakling had carried were transmitted vividly.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nBut I had to distinguish it clearly.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"This is not my emotion.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAdrias.</p>\\n

 <p>\\nIt was difficult for someone to become a magician without a talent for mana in the first place.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIf someone without talent wanted to become a magician, they had to have an immense amount of money.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n...So, is that why the family went bankrupt?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI put that aside for now and moved on to the specialty.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nWhen you start the game, you are randomly given one specialty.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nOf course, there were trash-like specialties that were not useful, but there were also good specialties that could survive with just one.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIn the game, I used to start over and over again until I got a good specialty.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nBut here, in this reality, I couldn\\'t use such a trick.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n[Dual Core]</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n-Epic\\n\\n-You have two mana storages.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n-The possibility of becoming a magic swordsman opens up.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAn epic-grade specialty.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nOf course, just by looking at the grade, it was a top-tier specialty.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAnd a magic swordsman, how romantic and appealing it was.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Nonsense.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI\\'ve died dozens of times chasing after romance.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nHaven\\'t I tried it myself?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI\\'ve seen the ending 12 times.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIf I didn\\'t dig just one well, I couldn\\'t break through.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nResources and time were limited, and the ability to be raised was doubled, so the speed of getting stronger was slower.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nOn top of that, this place was not a game but reality.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAlthough the grace period before the crisis came was extended, the important thing was that this place was reality.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"No, on the contrary, since it\\'s reality, should I raise a low-level character?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Haah.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI could only let out a sigh.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI\\'ve never had a no-death clear in the game.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nEven with characters much better than Adrias, there was no no-death clear.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>How on earth could I survive?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIf it were a game, I could make a decision to dig just one well, whether I died or not.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But if my goal was survival, the Dual Core specialty didn\\'t seem bad.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI, now, didn\\'t aim for game clear, but survival.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIn the end, the specialty was left as a trap, so let\\'s look at the talent below.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Honestly, I didn\\'t even want to see it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Do you have a useless talent?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Even if you do, is it just another useless talent?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>A-class talent is simply written as \\'magic\\' in just two words.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Or something like \\'swordsmanship\\'.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It\\'s not good when the content becomes too long like that.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It means you only have talent in that specific field.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But even that, I\\'m just another useless talent.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Especially in the case of useless talent, it has the opposite effect rather than having nothing at all.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If an ordinary person is 100, a useless talent means 70 to 80.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\'Water magic is a gem disease.\\' I realized it here.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It seems like the world wants to kill me and went crazy.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The reason why Adrias died countless times in the early stages of the game must be because of these insignificant abilities.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Lastly, skills were an extension of talent.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If you had exceptional talent, you could quickly raise the proficiency and level of skills, but if you had no talent, no matter how hard you tried, it wouldn\\'t work, especially with magic skills.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>-Dark Magic: Basic Command (3/100)</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>&gt;&gt; Summon Skeleton

proficiency in beginner-level elemental magic was astonishing, but he was only left with one elemental magic.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>When he realized that he had to show magical achievements to enter the Matop when he became a fifth-year student, it was obvious what his future would be like.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Oh, it was me, not him.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In the end, there was only one thing left for me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>-Ding!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>[There is an unselected trait.]</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Select trait.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Among the countless games I\\'ve played, I\\'ve never been able to choose traits as I pleased.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In this game, there were also elements of roguelike, so sometimes I could get traits when I defeated a mid-boss or achieved something, but they were all random.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I have to choose now to survive.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I returned to my dorm room and sat down on the chair, leaving the book behind.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And when the affirmative meaning was reflected in front of my eyes, the sentence changed.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>[Please choose the trait you want.]</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Hundreds of traits were listed in front of me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I carefully looked through the traits in the list.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>First, I selected all the normal and rare grade traits.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"There\\'s a trait like this?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I boasted that I had seen almost all the traits, but there were many things I had never found in epic or unique grades.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Especially unique traits were traits that could not be obtained even through game restarts, so except for two or three, they were all things I had never seen before.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And finally, one trait caught my eye strongly.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"This is....\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Without realizing it, my thoughts came out of my mouth.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And I pondered for a while.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>What is the best way for me to survive?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Is this really the best?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>How much resources and time do I have?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>What is the situation?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Hoo.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was difficult to make a decision easily because my life was at stake.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>There were piles of papers with notes that I had written while pondering in front of me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The conclusion that came out of there was...</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"In the end, I\\'m a necromancer.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It\\'s something I can\\'t deny.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Even if I don\\'t use it, I can\\'t erase what I\\'ve learned.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Then I have no choice but to use it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Only when my life is in danger.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Moreover, if a necromancer can grow safely, they are stronger than any other magician.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That\\'s why in the game, they were such a wicked existence that they would go and kill the necromancer first in every play.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"One of them is his master....</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Wait a minute.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I hurriedly checked the calendar.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I\\'m late.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Adrias\\' memories began to emerge.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I now remembered that I had promised to meet him last night.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was troublesome.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I won\\'t die...</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>probably.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I quickly put on the clothes I had taken off and prepared to go out.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I have to go find him now, or I\\'ll really die.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"But before that...\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I stopped thinking and chose the trait I had been thinking about.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Since it won\\'t solve anything even if I think about it for a few more days, I better get the trait and use it quickly.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Now that I\\'ve chosen the trait, my goal is to plan well and survive as much as possible.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And the next button for that goal will probably be where I\\'m going now.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In this damn situation, I will definitely survive.</p>\\n  </body>\\n</html>\\n'\n",

couldn\\'t imagine what kind of situation I would end up in.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, I couldn\\'t run away just because I was scared.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>What I needed was in that place.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"But still, I\\'m nervous.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It feels like going to work, no choice but to go.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAs I got closer to my home office, my steps became heavier.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>My mentor in dark magic and a professor at the academy, Karone Diflen, was not famous, but he had a solid support base as a mid-level professor.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>His coldness and calmness were powerful weapons for him to hide his identity as a dark mage.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>However, he was not the type to overlook mistakes like mine.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nWhen I arrived at Karone\\'s office, I could see that the light was still on.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Fortunately, he hadn\\'t left yet.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nKnock knock.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Professor Karone, it\\'s Adrias Cromwell.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI knocked on the door and waited for a moment, but there was no response.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After a tense moment, I heard a small voice from behind the door.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Come in.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI cautiously opened the door.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Inside, a middle-aged man with neatly arranged black hair was sitting at his desk, examining a magic tablet.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>By the way, that magic tablet was a magic tool similar to a smartphone from the world I used to live in.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"...Adrias.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Yes, Professor.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Didn\\'t I clearly say 11 o\\'clock?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"I\\'m sorry.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I must have mistaken the date.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nHis cold gaze passed by me like a snake\\'s tongue.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nA slightly uncomfortable time passed, and he stood up from his seat.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Follow me.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAs soon as I answered, he touched a book on the bookshelf.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The bookshelf moved aside, revealing a barrier.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Open.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nWith a simple interaction of mana, the light emitted from his ring touched the barrier, gradually fading away as it recognized its owner.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAs I followed him into the barrier, I felt the smell of various potions and decaying bodies vibrating in the air.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Even though Adrias has seen this several times, he still seems uncomfortable.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIt was like entering a slaughterhouse, with all kinds of corpses scattered around.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>There were not only animal, monster, and human bodies, but also bodies of different races.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Huff.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI suppressed my frown.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As I followed Karone further inside, the corpses, which were quite neatly arranged, were hanging from chains.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"I should have done this yesterday, but it doesn\\'t matter.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nKarone muttered to himself as he magically lowered one of the bodies.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"What are you doing?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Are you still not in your right mind?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nWhen I just stared at the body, Karone spoke to me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThen, my body automatically started gathering unknown potions.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was a familiar movement, as if it had been engraved in my body.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"So this is how it\\'s done.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nMemories came back to me naturally.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nFirst, I sprinkled a little bit of Mandragora\\'s blood on the central floor as instructed.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThen, Karone used magic to construct a magic circle with the blood.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"About here...\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI scattered Torokan\\'s root powder on the circle.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAnd I placed cursed objects and potions in their appropriate positions as the medium....</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Etcha.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nOnce the body was placed in the center, it was done.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Was the process this complicated?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIn the game, I could just resurrect the corpses and summon undead with a single spell.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But now, it was already giving me a headache.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAfter the preparations were done, Karone arranged mana and created a magic formation.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAs I watched the process, I felt an inexplicable gaze from somewhere and turned around.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"....\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIn the area with iron bars, a thin woman with a gagged mouth was staring at me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was the memory that came to mind when I saw her.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"A vampire.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nNo, this bastard Karone was even keeping a vampire?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Unlike vampires in other games or media, the vampires of the Sinful Vampire were treated as one species.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>They didn\\'t die just by exposure to sunlight.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Instead, they were incredibly rare, and I had only seen vampires a handful of times in the game.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"And because of that, I had to do the rites.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nVampires were individually powerful.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Along with their strong bodies, their unique blood magic provided a perfect balance of offense and defense.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Karone was certainly a strong mid-boss-level talent, but that was only in the middle of the game.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nI was curious about how Karan was able to restrain the vampire.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"And when I killed Karan, there was no trace of the vampire.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nOf course, I couldn\\'t be sure if this space was reproduced in the game, but it was strange that nothing related to the vampire came up until I died.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Could it be that he failed to turn the undead into a vampire?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Even in Adrius\\' memories, there was no mention of anything related to the vampire.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>He only supplied the vampire with food about once a month.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As I carefully recalled my memories, an unexpected conclusion came to mind unrelated to the vampire.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Now that I think about it, I was completely fooled, wasn\\'t I?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Adrius.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Now that I think about it, he not only lacked talent, but also had a lot of gullible qualities.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In his memories, he hardly learned anything from Karan and only focused on following him.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After learning the basics of strategy in the beginning, he didn\\'t learn anything else.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Hmm.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>A sound that awakened me echoed from the magic circle.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The magic circle, which had been emitting a sinister red light, gradually absorbed mana and formed a spell formation.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Crack.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Crash.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As the light intensified, the flesh of the corpse that had been lying there turned to dust and crumbled.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>-Whoa.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>What should I call that?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>A zombie skeleton?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But as soon as I had that thought, the undead that had just appeared fell apart.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Failed.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Karan\\'s calm voice echoed.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After saying that, Karan started writing something in his notebook.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Is it over?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Did he only call me for this one thing?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Now that I think about it, I\\'ve been called for much less important things before.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>While cursing inwardly, my body diligently cleaned up the dirty room.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Adrius.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes, Professor.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"...Professor?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Sorry, Master.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>He\\'s not a master even though he hasn\\'t taught me anything.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But I sent him a loyal gaze like a quick-witted recruit.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"It seems like it\\'s been more than a month since Angela\\'s food supply.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Angela was the name of the vampire trapped in the cage.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes, I will take care of it after I finish cleaning.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Adrius.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I thought you had changed, but you\\'ve become even more foolish.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>With that, he left.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Did he notice that I\\'ve changed?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As I entered Adrius\\' body, I also changed from my original personality.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But even so, I seemed different from Adrius, which made me wonder.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"If I pay attention to such things, I\\'ll die sooner.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I continued cleaning while muttering to myself.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After all, I\\'m just a small fry.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Only Karan would care about my changes.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If Karan\\'s reaction was only that, there was no need to worry about Adrius\\' actions and think about his memories every time.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I tried using magic during cleaning, just in case.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>There happened to be remnants of a medium and a discarded magic circle, which was a perfect environment for me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>[Basic Command: Summon Skeleton.]</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>[Warning!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>There are no summonable creatures left.]</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Oh?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>When I tried to use magic, it was as if it was programmed and the mana arrangement automatically came to my mind.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>When I arranged the mana and then constructed the spell formation, a proper command was activated.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It felt like a special benefit for the player.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"This way, there won\\'t be much burden, right?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Honestly, when I was planning in my room, I had a lot of worries about whether I had to learn the basics of magic again, even for dark magic.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In the end, I had to learn from scratch, even if it was for dark magic.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Generally, you can\\'t self-study dark magic.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It wasn\\'t for any particular reason, it was just that there was no way to learn the related knowledge.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In this world, dark magic was forbidden, so it was secretly passed down in the shadows.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If there were widely spread books or materials, I would have tried self-study, but there were no dark magic books.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>...Of course, this is the story of ordinary people.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I had the conditions to self-study.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"There are widely spread dark magic books here.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was the first growth plan I made.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That was Karan\\'s dark magic books.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Anyway, until I become strong, I can\\'t cut ties with Karan.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Then I should use him as much as possible.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Those were Karan\\'s belongings that I didn\\'t even think of touching as the original Adrius.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After finishing cleaning, I checked the items in the laboratory.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Even so, I quickly understood what was what.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Even if I use them little by little, it won\\'t be noticeable, right?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I soon examined the dark magic books that filled one side of the laboratory wall.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Introduction to Dark Magic, Basic Lecture for Dark Mages, You Can Do It.\\n\"Do dark magic!\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I took out the books that seemed to have a slightly makeshift feel compared to the ones I saw at the academy, but they were the most basic ones for now.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As I prepared to read the books in earnest, I felt a piercing gaze on me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Ah.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>When my eyes met with Angela, the vampire, I awkwardly scratched the back of my head and stood up from my seat.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Oh, I forgot to feed her.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Her meal wasn\\'t anything special.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>There was already plenty of blood from the widely spread corpses, and I only needed to give her a little bit of blood.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Following Adrius\\' memory, I brought a long hose and put it in a container filled with blood, passing it through the iron bars.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, the amount of blood wasn\\'t much.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Just enough to keep her from starving to death?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That\\'s when I heard a cracked voice.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"You...\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As I handed her the hose, I raised my head, wondering if I misheard something.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Did I mishear?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Still unsure, I asked Angela.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"What did you just say?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I didn\\'t remember her ever speaking.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Even though I spent over two years under Karon, she had never spoken before.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But she just stared at the hose in my hand, as if asking when she said it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I\\'m pretty sure she said something.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As I handed her the hose from a distance, she struggled to approach and sucked on the hose.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I don\\'t know how she got caught, but her will to survive was impressive.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After resolving her meal, I calmly started reading the book again, but I heard the voice once more.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Adrius.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>When I turned around, I saw her crimson eyes staring at me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"You\\'re not Adrius.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Who are you?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It wasn\\'t a mistake.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>My whole body froze as a chill ran down my spine.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But I calmly opened my mouth without showing any signs.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If I\\'m not Adrius, then who am I?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"If you were Adrius, you would have been flustered when I spoke.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Are you going crazy after being trapped here for so long?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>What do you want to say?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n

you doubt.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That should be enough.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Indeed.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If the guy who hadn\\'t said a word all this time suddenly started suspecting my true identity, it could be suspicious.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"It\\'s better to let you go than to die.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Are you afraid of dying from him?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"That\\'s not the only reason, but even if I don\\'t believe you, I can still make you doubt.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That should be enough.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Certainly.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After the guy mentioned that Karon seemed to have changed, it bothered me even more.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I closed the book and put it back in place, then stood in front of the iron bars.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Alright.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Have you made up your mind?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I can\\'t open this iron bar.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"That\\'s not a problem.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Just release this restraint.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Releasing the restraint also required magical dismantling.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Before I could think about whether I could do it or not, I demanded a definite answer.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Before that, swear that you won\\'t kill me.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Alright, I swear.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"No. Swear it to the family.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"...The family?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Don\\'t play dumb.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Until you swear to the family, there\\'s no way.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Although I said that, I was honestly skeptical.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Vampires have only one family.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And anyone would sacrifice their family\\'s name for something as life-threatening as this.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>So, there was no surefire way to confirm their sincerity.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"...\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But unexpectedly, Angela hesitated.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Why are you hesitating even though it\\'s just a verbal oath?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Honestly, even if she made the oath, I had no intention of releasing her.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I just wanted to buy some time to think.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After thinking for a long time, Angela finally opened her mouth.</p>\\n

ughhh!\"</h1>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Angela suddenly twisted her body and let out a scream.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"W-What have you done?!\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nWith those words, Angela\\'s eyes rolled back and she collapsed.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThe situation was so sudden that I couldn\\'t even react.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"...Hey, are you okay?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI tried speaking to her, but she remained silent as if she had fainted.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIn this unknown situation, I checked my chosen characteristic once again.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n[Evolution]</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>- Unique\\n- Develops a target from inferior to superior with sufficient experience\\n- Can be used on non-hostile targets\\n\\nThis characteristic enhanced and complemented the strengths and weaknesses of a necromancer, and had overall versatility.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Most of the unique characteristics were universal, so choosing any of them wouldn\\'t be a disadvantage.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But in the situation I was in, there was no better characteristic than this.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nOf course, since I had just obtained it, I didn\\'t know the exact usage or how much it would improve through evolution.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It seemed like the oath Angela had muttered earlier fulfilled the second condition.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAs I unintentionally became the first sacrifice for my characteristic, another message appeared.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n[Angela Lucifel]</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>[In the process of evolution...]</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>[Remaining time: 167 hours, 41 minutes, 03 seconds]</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nNearly a week\\'s worth of time was indicated.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It seemed like it would take this long.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But for now, I was grateful for the time I had gained.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I had to leave my place empty for the task Karone had given me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I didn\\'t know what Angela might say to Karone during this time.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was better to have her in this unconscious state to avoid such worries.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nWhen I checked the time, it was already late at night.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I quickly organized everything, checked Angela once again, and returned to my dorm room.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nOnce I returned to my room, I immediately checked my schedule.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Of all times...\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIf I wanted to go to the Empty Hartz National Cemetery as Karone instructed, I had to leave right away.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The problem was that I might have to skip classes the next afternoon.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Do I really need to die or not?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Are these lectures that important?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nTo be honest, they were important.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Very important.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAs you know, the Adrius family is in a dire financial situation, with debts and barely enough wealth.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In this difficult life, I was fortunate enough to be selected as a scholarship recipient due to the passing of my ancestor, the former Viscount.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThanks to that, I was able to barely cover the tuition with the scholarship benefits.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If I were to skip classes without permission, even that might disappear.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nMy head was complicated, but my body was already prepared to go out.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I even brought a disguise outfit just in case and dragged my luggage.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Let\\'s resolve this as quickly as possible.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If I\\'m lucky, I might be able to return by tomorrow afternoon.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAfter planning my route in my head, I immediately took action.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIt was late at night, so there was not a single person passing by outside.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>However, the mana railway station near the academy, which operated 24 hours, was still brightly lit.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Ah.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nWhen I took out my wallet to calculate the ticket cost, I realized that I only had enough money to buy a round trip ticket.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"That damn Karone.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>At least he should give me some pocket money for running errands.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI cursed him silently and paid for the ticket before boarding the mana express train.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nCome to think of it, Karone had never given me any money even though he had asked me to do errands for him.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It seemed like he thought it was only natural for me to pay since I was learning dark magic for free.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But I was different.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"After I come back this time, I\\'ll at least bring it up.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I don\\'t even have money for food.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI stared blankly at the boxed lunches being sold on the train and only satisfied my appetite.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nDuring the train ride, I took a short break and read the book I had brought.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was borrowed from the library the previous day.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"I don\\'t understand what all this nonsense is about.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nBut I forced myself to read it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI had to familiarize myself with the words and terms, even if it meant forcing my brain awake.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After about six hours, I arrived at the Heartbell Station, where the national cemetery was located.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As soon as I got off, I headed straight towards the cemetery.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In truth, I wanted to take a carriage near the station, but I didn\\'t have any money.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Damn money.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I need to solve this money problem first.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In the game, I rarely had to worry about money.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I simply used my character\\'s skills to earn money, but now I had no skills or talents, so I had to find another way.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Fortunately, I had memorized various things while playing the game, and even as a character like Adrias with no special traits, there were still ways.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"The problem is that I don\\'t even have initial funds.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The more I thought about it, the more pathetic my character seemed.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But what could I do?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>This is who I am now.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Since I was in a hurry to go back, I ran with all my strength, dragging my luggage all the way to the cemetery.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And less than five minutes later, I felt my breath running out.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I should exercise regularly if I want to survive.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Stamina is essential to survive.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But my stamina was low, as if I were a wizard.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>No, if that\\'s the case, I should at least have a talent for magic.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After a fierce battle that lasted almost an hour, I barely managed to reach the entrance of the cemetery.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The sky was already dawn.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I came from the Jenis residence.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n

<br/>\\n    <p>Go in.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After exchanging the designated greetings with the gatekeeper, I entered.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The society of dark wizards may have been hidden in the shadows, but their power was by no means small.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>This empty Hartz National Cemetery was already one of the places bought by the dark wizards.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As I passed through the main gate and entered inside, I saw hundreds of tombstones and one cemetery worker in the spacious outdoors.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I immediately approached the cemetery worker who was working.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Mr. Pyreman.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Are you running an errand for Caron?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>You came early.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>You mentioned Bayden\\'s tomb.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I\\'ve already prepared it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It should be over there.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As if he had already received the message, he pointed in a direction where a coffin that hadn\\'t been buried yet could be seen.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Or maybe it was a coffin that had already been buried and dug up.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Thank you.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As I said that, I noticed the identity of the corpse that the cemetery worker was working on.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Lifheal!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Nickel Lifheal!\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was actually one of the Easter eggs in the game.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The story goes like this: A man who idolized Ora Master suddenly started training with a sword for decades.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Cutting off worldly ties, he trained with the sword without missing a day.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Eventually, he became an Ora Master, but the moment he became an Ora Master, he died from overexertion.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It\\'s a strange story of a plain man without talent for the sword finally becoming an Ora Master and dying.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Ora Masters in this world are truly monsters beyond human comprehension.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It\\'s ridiculous that he became a monster and died instantly.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That\\'s why it\\'s called an Easter egg.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And this Easter egg is ultimately just a reference to the story of Cadreus.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But why bother creating such an Easter egg?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"It must mean that he was a real Ora Master.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Otherwise, why would they go through so much trouble to create an Easter egg like this?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>However, since it was a useless Easter egg, I didn\\'t pay much attention to it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Even I, who played the game meticulously, couldn\\'t immediately recall\\nI couldn\\'t do it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"But Nickel Lifehill...\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>My heart pounded.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The fact that Nickel Lifehill had become an Overmaster was not officially known, as he had died without any official announcement.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>He was only known through rumors in the village where he lived.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Honestly, it was an unimaginable death considering the image of an Overmaster.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That\\'s why the value of this corpse is probably unknown to anyone.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"The abilities of a summoned creature resurrected by necromancy are proportional to their abilities in their previous life.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If I were to create something like a Death Knight with this...\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, even Karone can\\'t create a top-tier summon like a Death Knight right now.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But it was obvious that if I were to create something like a skeleton with this, its level would far surpass that of an ordinary skeleton.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Just as I was about to pass by naturally, the gravedigger, wiping the sweat from his forehead, looked at me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Are you done?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes, I\\'ve finished.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Good.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Say hello to Karone for me.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes, Mr. Pyman.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As I was about to pass by naturally, I threw a glance at him.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Oh, by the way.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Huh?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>What is it?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Is there any way I can get assigned a corpse to make my own summon?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Maybe?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Hmm.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>How many years has it been for you?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"It\\'s been three years now.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Ha!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>You\\'re still a fledgling with a lot of ambition.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Is that so?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Haha.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As I pretended to laugh coolly, he wiped the sweat from his forehead once again and said.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I understand how you feel, but first, get permission from Karone.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That\\'s the fastest way.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Of course, that makes sense.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I understand.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Thank you for your advice.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>...Did you think I would say that?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I had already discovered the corpse of an Overmaster, and not just anyone, but a corpse that no one would even suspect to be an Overmaster.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I couldn\\'t let it go like this.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I hesitated for a moment, but ultimately made a decision.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Taking off the ring I had in my hand, I said to Pyman.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Mr. Pyman.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Why again?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Aren\\'t you going?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Can I take this corpse with me if I use this ring?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Pyman\\'s eyes widened at the ring I held out to him.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But in an instant, he hid his emotions and spoke as if nothing had happened.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"As I said earlier, you can\\'t do it without Karone\\'s permission.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If I were to give you a corpse and it was found out by that guy, I would be in a difficult position too.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"You don\\'t have to worry about that.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I can manage it without getting caught.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Hmm.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Is that so?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It\\'s still a little awkward...\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Please, Mr. Pyman.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I have nothing but this ring.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But as a dark magician, achieving my goal is my priority.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Please accept it.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Oh, this shouldn\\'t be happening...\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In the end, he pretended to give in and accepted my ring.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>He probably thought he had completely fooled me, right?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Well, that ring was the signet ring of Count Cromwell, a noble family with three generations of power.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"It\\'s just a ring.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I can earn money and get it back later.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Right now, securing any resources I can get my hands on is a priority.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Anyway, I was planning to exchange that ring for money in the first place.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It would be much more profitable to use that money to obtain the corpse of an Overmaster.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Alright.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>You said you wanted this corpse, right?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Take it.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Thank you.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>We both hid our true intentions and took advantage of each other.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Pyman was probably delighted to sell the corpse of an ordinary old man at a high price, even though he wasn\\'t a young knight.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Although the Cromwell family was a noble family with three generations of power, it was still just a signet ring, so it would fetch a high price.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Still, compared to the corpse of an Overmaster, it was like a drop in the bucket.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Money can\\'t buy something like that, even if you have a lot of it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If people knew it was the corpse of an Overmaster, they would grab their throats and collapse.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>When I opened the coffin and saw the old man who looked like he had died recently with his eyes closed.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I entrust this to you, my first subordinate.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I carefully took out the corpse as if handling a baby.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was exhausting, but to me, it was something that couldn\\'t be compared to any treasure.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I could only smile.</p>\\n

immediately returned to the academy.</h1>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As soon as I arrived, I left my suitcase in the room and ran without even wiping off my sweat.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I barely made it to class on time by dragging my exhausted body, which was screaming that it couldn\\'t do it anymore, with my mental strength.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nTak!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Hmm?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Sorry for being late.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Huh, huh.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Although I was about 10 minutes late, my efforts seemed to have gone unnoticed by the professor, who resumed the class without paying any attention to it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Despite attracting some attention by forcefully opening the door, I ignored it and sat in an empty seat.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAnd as expected, the curious gazes that were directed at me faded away in less than five seconds.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"It\\'s nice to be popular.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I almost got dust in my eyes for a moment, but I decided to just let it go.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"...As you all know, the Mahaim leaf has excellent nourishing effects, but if the intake exceeds a certain threshold, it becomes a chronic poison.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>This poison induces headaches along with hallucinogenic effects, but it can be utilized...\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Intermediate Herbology by Professor Bevan.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The relationship between magicians and herbs is inseparable.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Herbs are essential experimental materials and mediators in dealing with numerous potions and magical tools.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, not only herbs but also various other ingredients, such as monster byproducts, are used, but herbs had the advantage of being relatively inexpensive compared to other ingredients.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, the prices of rare herbs were ridiculously high, but let\\'s put that aside for now.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Even in the game, even if you weren\\'t a magician, you had to memorize the names and combination methods of herbs for doping potions and recovery potions.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"For example, if you mix the Mahaim leaf with three additional ingredients, you can create an excellent stamina-boosting potion.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>While listening to the professor\\'s words, I realized that something was off.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Three ingredients?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Wasn\\'t it six?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In the game, it took seven ingredients, including the Mahaim leaf, to create a stamina-boosting potion.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Adding only three ingredients meant it was a temporary stamina-boosting stimulant, which was even worse than a debuff that caused a decrease in stats once the buff wore off.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>No one seemed to question it, so I ended up speaking up.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I couldn\\'t resist my curiosity.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Um, Professor!\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Hmm?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>What is it?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Are the three ingredients you mentioned the Jahas fruit, Todor Tree sap, and Mel fruit?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes, that\\'s right.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Are the Honfisi sap or Matarata root bark not included?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Huh.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Why would those be included?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If you want to know, try it yourself.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The professor sarcastically replied, and the laughter of the students spread as if they were mocking me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I was momentarily taken aback, but I thanked him and took my seat without showing any signs of it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Why is it different from the game?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If it wasn\\'t something else...</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Could it be that the combination method hadn\\'t been discovered yet?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The thought sent shivers down my spine.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I should go to the library as soon as the class is over.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I wanted to check the book that listed the types of potions and reagents.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If there were specialized books for my major, I could have checked those, but as a slacker like Adrias, I had never bought a single book.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Finally, after the class ended, I headed straight to the library, but someone called out to me and stopped me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Senpai.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>At first, I thought it wasn\\'t me who was being called, so I walked out, but when I heard the voice again, I stopped in my tracks.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Adrias Cromwell senpai.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Addressing me by my full name, the girl with sleepy eyes looked at me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>A gust of wind blew, and her pinkish white short hair fluttered like cherry blossoms.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I barely managed to relax my stiff face when I realized who she was.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Lucia Everlast.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The girl with a mysterious atmosphere and drowsy eyes had come closer to me without me noticing.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I have a question to ask you.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"What is it?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I didn\\'t know why she called me, but I found myself getting nervous.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Perhaps my awkwardness seemed strange to her, as Lucia tilted her head slightly, but she quickly ignored it and asked her question.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Why did you ask that question earlier?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I never expected her to be in the same class.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was still early in the semester, and Adrias had only become a student recently, so I didn\\'t know much about the situation around me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Come to think of it, if she wasn\\'t a freshman, she would have had a reason to take an advanced herbology class.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Oh, it\\'s just...</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I thought it would suit you well.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Honfisi, huh?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Honestly, I can understand to some extent up to Matarata, but why did you suddenly mention Honfisi?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That combination method was the result of my efforts.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>This unfriendly game didn\\'t provide any information other than basic combination methods.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>One day, I took the time and mixed various random items for a week.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Fortunately, there was a system in the game that provided hints when items were mixed, even if the combination failed.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The combination methods that are now in my head were completed based on those hints.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I came up with it because of the Mohaim fruit.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Why did the Mohaim fruit suddenly come up?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"As you know, the Mohaim fruit has much stronger effects than its leaves, but it also has more side effects.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And one of those side effects is similar to highly addictive drugs.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"But...\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"To neutralize it, I needed the bark of the Matarahta root that I mentioned earlier.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But I couldn\\'t completely remove it, so I thought the Honpishi would be perfect for neutralizing it.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"So, senior, do you think you can make a stamina potion with the fruit?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I\\'m not sure.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I couldn\\'t say anything more.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>This could be a money-making opportunity for me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, there are dozens, hundreds of other combination methods.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I can\\'t remember them all, but I should write down the ones I can remember somewhere.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Honpishi...\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>When I suddenly saw her lost in thought, I wondered if I had said too much.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was a random thought, but seeing the character that I had seen with low-quality graphics in the game now in live-action was mind-blowing.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In the game, it was so pixelated, but in reality, it was like slapping a celebrity\\'s face.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Along with that random thought, a faint memory came to mind.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Ah, you must have had a hard time too.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>She was the character I raised as the third, or rather, the last wizard.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>She was the ninth character overall.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The difficulty level was extreme.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Her talent was extraordinary, to the point where people would say she was crazy.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Just a little training would greatly increase her mana and skill proficiency, and watching her progress, the obstacles that had blocked her were easily overcome.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In terms of talent alone, she was probably superior to Dienne, whom I encountered the day before.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But why was her difficulty level so extreme...</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Hmm?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>You\\'re still here?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>You can leave now.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I\\'m done with what I needed from you.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Alright.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Take care.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Are all geniuses so arrogant?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But I didn\\'t want to show my dislike, so I smiled and left.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It didn\\'t matter anyway, as she would probably die within a few years.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The reason for her high difficulty level was none other than an incurable disease.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"She was the character I played with the most.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>No, to be precise, not just played, but started a completely new game.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I counted up to the twentieth time I started anew, but after that, I gave up counting.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That\\'s how difficult her treatment was, even for me now...</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Wait a moment...\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As I thought about it, a possibility came to mind.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I might be able to save her.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Because I already had the experience of clearing the game.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>She was the reason I had to come up with hundreds of combination methods.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Her treatment was difficult because finding the combination method was challenging, but if I had the ingredients, it could be easily solved.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Of course, the ingredients are not easy to obtain either.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But it\\'s true that I can save her if I know the combination method.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The problem was what would happen once I saved her.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"When I played, I definitely killed Adrias.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If I couldn\\'t cure the disease, she would die before harming Adrias.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But if I cured the disease, it would be her who would harm Adrias.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Lost in thought, I suddenly arrived at the library.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Where can I find books on potions and reagents?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Oh, if you\\'re talking about that, they were just returned.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Here.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It seemed someone had brought them to the herbology class.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>They must have returned them right after the lecture ended.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I wanted to check the books right away, but I had something to do before that.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I should go see the self-proclaimed master.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I should hurry and hand over the corpse and do what I need to do.</p>\\n

time left and could eat the school cafeteria food with the coupon I had pre-purchased.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Adrias.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes, Professor.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"You

<br/>\\n    <p>Karen continued to speak without looking away from his book, but he glanced at the carrier bag I brought.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I said I\\'ll give you two days, did you already bring it?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I thought it meant yesterday and today were the two days, but it seems like it wasn\\'t the case.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Well, considering the time, it was too early to bring it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Karen, who kept talking, glanced at the carrier bag I brought.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I\\'ll take a look at it later.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Okay.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I had something to do before checking the books anyway.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I should go see the so-called master.\"</p>\\n

word and got up from his seat.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Follow me.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Just like the previous day, we walked through the barrier and entered the research lab.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As soon as we entered, Karon immediately ordered me to retrieve the corpses.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The inside of the carrier, which had a space expansion magic on it, was pitch dark and nothing could be seen.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I reached out my hand and pulled out the larger of the two corpses that could be felt.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Kkungcha.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was definitely the body of a young knight, so it was bulky and heavy.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As I struggled to retrieve the corpse, Karon stood silently, stroking his chin, lost in thought.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>While he was silent, I glanced at Angela, just in case.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>- Kuuul....</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>She looks very pleased.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>At least nothing went wrong, thankfully.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If she had been harmed, even without evidence that I was responsible, she would have become an experimental subject due to Karon\\'s anger.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"His condition is better than I thought.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I\\'ll turn him into a chimera undead.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>At the word chimera, my body reflexively resisted.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, it wasn\\'t because of an upset stomach or anything, but because I had a lot of things to do.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Fortunately, it wasn\\'t something that had to be done immediately.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It required a period of applying various reagents to the knight\\'s corpse and allowing it to mature.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, I had to do most of the work myself.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Time has already passed like this.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>While I was working, Karon, who was playing with the reagents next to me, said.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Then, without saying a word, he left the research lab.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"When you\\'re done, place it on the magic circle I made and activate the spell.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>With the voice that faintly echoed from the office connected to the research lab, the research lab closed.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Haah.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>This bastard.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>He orders me around without giving me a single penny.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Oh, money!\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I realized that I had forgotten the train fare.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Next time, I must remember to mention it and tear it up.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I finished my work meticulously and activated the magic circle.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Then, I stretched and yawned, seeing the ominous energy emitting from it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I endured the fatigue that came from overexerting my body for two days with my mental strength.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Ah.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Just as I was about to read the dark magic book, I remembered the remaining nickel in the carrier.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Should I make it now?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The storage method would be a problem if I made it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I didn\\'t have any experience raising necromancers, so I didn\\'t know for sure, but I often saw them storing the creatures in another dimension and summoning them when needed...</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Do I have another dimension too?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After all, spatial magic could only be used by high-level magicians.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I thought for a moment and decided that if it didn\\'t work, I would just store it in the carrier.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It wouldn\\'t matter if it was stored as a corpse.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Karon wouldn\\'t check anyway.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As I pulled out Nickel\\'s corpse, an old man with a courteous demeanor appeared.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>When I saw his body, I had some doubts.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Is it really Master Oller?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I wondered if I had mistaken something.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If it was a mistake, then I had used an incredible amount of mana for nothing.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"No, it can\\'t be.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Easter eggs can\\'t be fake.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Trust me and trust the game.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>...Thinking like this, neither side seemed reliable, and I felt a little discouraged.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I felt a little regretful as I tried to use the necromancy.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If my necromancy level was high, I could summon something other than a regular skeleton, like a Durahan or a Dark Warrior, or even a Ghoul.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That\\'s why most necromancers store exceptional corpses instead of using them.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Now is not the time to be picky.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Besides, I chose this trait with this situation in mind.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If it evolves, it will somehow resolve it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Still, I added Karon\\'s reagents and some other ingredients without showing any signs of it, with the determination to do what I could.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>[Basic Necromancy:

Clear the End of Baal!]</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>[Free play is now available.]</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>[A new character has been unlocked!]</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI let go of the mouse, ignoring the message that I\\'ve seen over 10 times already.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThud.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I stretched my body as hard as I could, and my whole body screamed in relief.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nWhen I checked the time, it was 11 AM.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nEven though I stayed up all night, I felt fine.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThump.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Thump.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nTap.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Hello?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>- Kim Jin-ho!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>How are you doing?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Oh, is it already lunchtime?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>- Yeah.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I called during my break.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>What were you doing?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Playing a game.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>- You\\'re still playing?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I turned my gaze to the game filling up the computer screen.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yeah.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>- I got bored and quit a long time ago.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Is it really that fun?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yeah, it is.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>- Look at you, talking like that.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Why are you so nonchalant?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I couldn\\'t help but burst into dry laughter at the sound of Yong-ho\\'s voice coming through the phone.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Thanks for the game, hyung.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>- Ugh.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Goosebumps.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I shouldn\\'t have done that.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Don\\'t say things like that again.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Then, Yong-ho suddenly brought up an old story.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>- It\\'s been four years since you entered society, right?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"....\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>- The difficult times are over.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Now, go out, meet some girls, and enjoy yourself.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I\\'ll try my best.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>-Tsk.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I know it won\\'t go as you want it to.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But our motto was always about turning the impossible into possible, right?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It\\'s already been four years.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The military organization I was a part of disbanded due to an unexpected event.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, it was a good thing.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was something to be happy about.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But because it happened so suddenly, I still couldn\\'t grasp the situation.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I thought reunification with North Korea only happened in novels.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, only the unit I was in disbanded, and other units were still active.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The unit I was in disappeared quickly because it wouldn\\'t be good if it became known.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After organizing my thoughts for a moment, I opened the refrigerator to fill my stomach.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Then, let\\'s meet up sometime.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>- Oh, that\\'s great!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Let\\'s meet this weekend.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I\\'ll come to your place.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After ending the call, I lightly threw my phone onto the bed.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Yong-ho, who I just talked to on the phone, was a fellow soldier from the same unit as me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>He was discharged earlier than me due to an accident, but now he\\'s working fine at a company.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I stared at the freezer for a while, but in the end, I took out a frozen food item.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>When I was in the military, even my diet was managed, so I never thought I would be able to eat something like this again.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Being in a strictly controlled and managed unit caused me to have a strong aftereffect from the sudden discharge.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Because of that, I couldn\\'t adapt to society.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, I had enough money from the salary I saved up and the compensation I received from the forced discharge.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As a result, I became a well-off misfit, going here and there, but with Yong-ho\\'s help, I was able to improve a lot.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Ding!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The quickly heated frozen dumplings emitted steam.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I moved the dumplings to the desk and sat back down in my seat.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Peccata.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That\\'s the name of the game currently displayed on the screen.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After being discharged, I was in such a serious state that not even Yong-ho could do anything for me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>During that time, I tried various things for two years, saying that I\\'m removing the military from my life, but problems always arose.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I owe a lot to Yong-ho hyung.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>During that time, Yong-ho hyung coincidentally brought a game CD.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Following his advice to take it easy and clear my mind first, I tried playing the game.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The graphics were bad, but the high degree of freedom, numerous branching paths, and various playable characters quickly drew me into the game.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Since I had never played a game before in my life, I had no sense for it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But I kept playing and eventually cleared it in a year.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The feeling of emptiness, wondering if this was the end, quickly disappeared.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Because the number of playable characters continued to increase as I cleared the game.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And the unlocked characters started with much worse conditions than before.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>[Tarman (Martial Artist)]</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Even the character I just cleared was of an unprecedented difficulty level.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I was frustrated, having repeated the cycle of life and death more than 10 times, even with my experience of clearing the game.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Sometimes, if I liked the character I had cleared, I would play a little longer, but not this time.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As I took a bite of dumplings, I tried to check the newly unlocked character.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nDududududu.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Who is it?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nToday, the phone kept ringing.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>There was no one who would call me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I checked the number and it showed \"caller ID restricted\".</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>A mysterious tension ran down my spine, and I hesitated on whether to answer or not.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Although it has been disbanded now, the unit I belonged to was an extremely confidential unit with no room for mistakes.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Honestly, it was surprising that the government just let us go.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Should I be grateful that they didn\\'t silence us by killing us?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Because of this, whenever I saw a caller ID restriction, I couldn\\'t help but feel nervous.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nClick.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThe call ended.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nWithout realizing it, a sigh escaped my lips.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nDududududu.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAnd as if mocking my sigh, the phone rang again.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIn the end, I decided to answer and immediately pressed the call button.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Hello.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n- Ah, ah.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Can you hear me?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Who is this?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n- Can you hear me?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"I can hear you.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Who is this?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAlthough the voice sounded playful, it was hard to tell the gender.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIt sounded like a distorted voice.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n- Ah!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I am the developer of Peccata.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nPeccata?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI wondered what that meant, but as soon as he mentioned the developer, I remembered the game I was playing.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Sin?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n- Yes!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That\\'s right.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nHe chuckled and continued.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n- Anyway, I checked and it turns out that Mr. Kim Jin-hwan has cleared the game a whopping 12 times.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Thank you for enjoying our game so much and congratulations.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nMy breath stopped when my name came out of his mouth.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nEven if it\\'s the game, how does he know my name?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIt was Yong-ho hyung who brought the game CD.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nDid Yong-ho hyung tell him?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>No, that\\'s impossible.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"How do you know my name?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n- Um, let\\'s put that aside for now and let me explain the special benefits.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"I\\'m asking you how you know my name.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Answer me.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n- Well, first of all, we will give Mr. Kim Jin-hwan a more realistic gameplay experience.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And in addition, in the next round, we will give you two special abilities.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>One is random as always, and the second is the opportunity to choose.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>How about it?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Isn\\'t it great?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAs soon as I heard that, I immediately hung up the phone.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAnd I called Yong-ho hyung.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n- The phone is turned off, beep...</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAlthough I had just made a call earlier, it didn\\'t connect.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI compulsively opened the closet and packed my things.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAn ominous feeling kept piercing through my mind.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"I have to change my location first.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>They might have tracked my location...</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>No, they might have known my location from the beginning.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAfter packing my things roughly, as I was about to go out, I saw the computer screen that was turned on.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Just in case, I should format the computer too.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI sat in front of the desk for a moment and tried to turn off the game when I looked at the screen.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n[Playable Character: Kim Jin-hwan (Adrias Cromwell)]</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nWhat is this?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nWhy is my name on the game screen?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nBefore I could finish that thought, the screen gradually turned black, as if it was turning into a sticky liquid.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nBefore I could even try to avoid that supernatural phenomenon, my mind turned black just like the screen.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Adrias!\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nWith a sharp shout, an empty flask flew towards me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI effortlessly caught the flying bottle and calmly looked at Silbeck.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"I clearly told you to organize \\'The Contradiction between Nature and Mana\\' and put it on the desk today!\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI cautiously nodded my head.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Yes.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Yes?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Yes?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But why is there nothing on my desk?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nWell, that\\'s because I don\\'t even know what magic is, let alone mana.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nOf course, I didn\\'t say that out loud.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nWithout saying a word, I just stood there, and Silbeck\\'s face turned red with anger.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Go out right now and bring it to me!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Hurry!\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIn response to his anger, I\\nI left the office without looking back.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As I stepped outside, I could feel the gazes of numerous students passing by in the hallway.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"What are you looking at?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Have you never seen someone before?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nOops.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I said what I was thinking out loud.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It seems like my impulsive nature has influenced my personality.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nFortunately, those who heard my words just gave me pitiful looks without any objections and went on their way.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I had more important things to prioritize than those looks, so I headed towards the library.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAs I stepped outside the building, I saw a wide open space with architectural styles reminiscent of the medieval era.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And above all, I noticed a towering tower that seemed to pierce through the sky, and three huge moons filling the sky.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n*Ding!*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"There are unselected attributes.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThe Korean characters that I was looking up at were now blocked from my sight.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"I\\'ll choose them later.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Later.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nPeople here are even babbling in a language they can\\'t understand, Korean.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI let out a deep sigh.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIt\\'s been a week since I came here.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI was sure I was going to format my computer, but when I woke up, I realized that I wasn\\'t myself anymore.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I had become Adrian Cromwell, not Kim Jin-ho.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIt was confusing, but I hid my emotions.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThe more crisis I faced, the more I practiced hiding my emotions.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI should consider myself lucky, I had some memories of being Adrian.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nOf course, I didn\\'t know his entire life, but I was able to grasp where this place was.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nRecalling it, this place was a world of \"sin\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>called \"Peccata.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAdrian\\'s memories were no different from the game world of \"Peccata.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAnd as I reviewed Adrian\\'s memories during this week, it became even more certain.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI am currently inside the game world.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"I want to find a book.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"What kind of book?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"\\'Conflicting Understanding of Nature and Mana.\\'\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Magic-related books are located from the 9th row of the 5th column to the 438th column of the 32nd row.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nSo they won\\'t find it for me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAre they trying to make money off me?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI shook my head.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nLately, thoughts that I wouldn\\'t normally have have been popping up in my head.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIt seems like Adrian\\'s influence is quite significant.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Of all characters....\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAmong the many characters, it had to be this guy.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI never even raised this guy in the first place.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAfter the law enforcer Tarmund, I raised him last.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"But still...</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>hasn\\'t the difficulty level increased too suddenly?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAdrian Cromwell was an undeniable villain.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nBut what should I say?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nHe was a character that could be considered worthless for the player, to the point that he could be seen as experience points for the player.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThe problem lies with his mentor.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nNo, should I even call that guy his mentor?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"I found it.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nWhile lost in thought, I finally found the book I was looking for.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nLuckily, it was arranged in alphabetical order, so I found it quickly.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI immediately opened the book.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"...Interesting.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIt was different from the game.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIn the game, I had raised three mage characters.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nBut the contents of this book were about capturing clouds in the sky.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIn reality, it wasn\\'t as simple as just learning a skill and using it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nMagic had to be activated through a complex and intricate process using mana, just like the contents of this book.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Of course, this is just a theoretical book.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI sighed inwardly and took the book with me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI didn\\'t plan on organizing the book, but I had to act in a way that wouldn\\'t arouse suspicion.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAs I walked back, carrying the book, I once again thought about myself, about Adrian.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI, who had no sense in the game, knew about all the characters through note-taking.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAt first, this guy dies quickly in the early stages of the game.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI didn\\'t kill all the playable characters, but I remember killing him at least eighteen times out of twelve characters.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nWhy did I have to kill this useless mage?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThis guy\\'s mage identity is just a disguise.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nHis true identity is a necromancer, specializing in necromancy and enchantment.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI became a necromancer, one of the most forbidden mages in this world.</p>\\n  </body>\\n</html>\\n'\n",

posture, the girl exuded an aura that seemed to come naturally, rather than being forced.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In fact, she was blossoming into a beautiful woman, making it difficult to still call her a girl.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nWith each step she took, her dark hair fluttered, capturing the attention of those around her.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\n\"That\\'s Dienne Yang.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I heard she got a perfect score on the magic dynamics test.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Yeah, I\\'m in the same class as her.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It\\'s been nine years since someone got a perfect score.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Makes me wonder if she\\'s even human.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Wow, really?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I want to take the same class too.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>How can someone be so perfect, from looks to abilities?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Are looks and abilities the only things that matter?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>What about her background?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAs Dienne calmly and confidently walked forward, ignoring the surrounding chatter, she suddenly noticed someone.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nAt first, she thought she had seen wrong and tried to ignore it, but she soon realized that her eyes weren\\'t mistaken and stopped in her tracks.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\n\"Adrias Cromwell.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThe eldest son of the Cromwell Viscount.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Well, he can\\'t be called a viscount anymore.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>He\\'ll probably be demoted soon.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nThe reason she looked at him, despite his lowly status, was not for any other reason.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>His family owed a debt to her family.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nThat\\'s why they had crossed paths several times since they were young, and they had even been somewhat friendly.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\n\"It was different when we were ignorant children.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nBut now, they were just creditor and debtor.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Ever since the previous Viscount Cromwell died two years ago, Adrias had shown nothing but deference whenever he saw her.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>He was like a bug.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nHe had no talent, no abilities, and he didn\\'t even make an effort.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>He simply existed because he was born, a worthless creature that didn\\'t even bother to hide his pathetic appearance for a moment of peace.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nBut...</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\n\"Why?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nSomething was different today.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>His usual disheveled hair and foolish face were the same as always.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nBut it wasn\\'t his usual slouched posture, and his perpetually gloomy expression seemed filled with a strange sense of melancholy.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nOf course, she had seen him with a troubled expression before, but this was different from what she had seen in the past.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nSuddenly, her gaze fell on the book he was holding.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\n\"Conflicting Understanding of Nature and Mana?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIt was a book she had already mastered.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It wasn\\'t a book that such a worthless person could understand.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>There must be some errand or some other reason for him to have it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nThe Adrias she knew was that kind of person.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\n\"Hmm?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAs if sensing her gaze, he snapped out of his thoughts and looked in her direction.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\n\"....\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAfter a moment, he slightly bowed his head and continued on his way.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\n...He just continued on his way?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nTrying to act natural, she turned around to look, and he really was just walking away.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\n\"Huh?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAn involuntary exclamation escaped her lips.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The fact that she made a sound was a blow to her pride.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\n\"Adrias, right?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nHe seemed like a completely different person.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nFrom a distance, she had been unsure, but seeing him up close, the atmosphere was different.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nDid Adrias, who used to just greet her and pass by, really just pass by without a word?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\n\"Weird.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nRather than getting angry, curiosity and doubt surged within her like waves.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nShe had thought he was a worthless bug.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nBut something must have happened during all this time.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\n*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Dienne Alben.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Wow, gives me chills.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nFeeling the lingering gazes, I quickened my pace.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I didn\\'t want to get involved with whoever was staring at me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nDienne Alben.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The prodigy of the Alben Duke, and one of the most talented mages.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nShe was also a character I had played in the game and now, as the owner of this body, the closest playable character to Adrias.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nThat meant she was the most likely one to kill me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\n\"But seeing her alive and breathing like this gives me a fresh perspective.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAs the game progressed, the characters became more pitiful, and the difficulty increased due to the nature of the game.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Characters like Dienne Alben, with high specs, were meant for beginners.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nI remember choosing her as my third character, and her talent and her family\\'s power couldn\\'t be ignored.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The Alven Duke\\'s family boasted such immense power that they were referred to as one of the four pillars supporting the empire.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Come to think of it, I also owe them a debt.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nA painful memory suddenly came to mind.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThe shame and inferiority complex that this weakling had carried were transmitted vividly.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nBut I had to distinguish it clearly.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"This is not my emotion.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAdrias.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAlthough he was just a character who appeared as a lackey, I was truly devoted to the game to the point where I had found all the information about him that could be found in the game.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It may be an exaggeration to say that.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nEven though I didn\\'t know the detailed settings, I couldn\\'t let myself die like before.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Now I am Adrias.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI am Kim Jin-ho, also known as Adrias.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAlthough it took me almost a week to accept it, I had to do my best to survive now.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAnd the first button was already set.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Specialty.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nOne of the reasons why it took me so long to accept this reality.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nHere, there was a mixture of reality and game-like abilities.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nTo be more precise, it seemed that only I had such abilities.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n-Ding!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n[There is an unselected specialty.]</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThis screen was the evidence.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIf it wasn\\'t for this, maybe I could have adapted a little faster.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI would have thought it was a dream if a game-like window appeared in front of me, ignoring the place and the people around me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAlthough I had adapted now, at first, I thought I was going crazy.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI closed the game window and checked my information.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n[Adrias Cromwell]</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n-Human\\n\\n-Mana: 1581\\n\\n-Specialty: Dual Core\\n\\n-Talent: Black Magic Commander (Universal), Elemental Magic Water (Supplementary)</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n-Skill: Black Magic Details&gt; Elemental Magic Details&gt;\\n\\nIt was a miserable sight.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nFirst, the amount of mana.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIf there was no talent related to mana, that amount was usually average.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nBut you couldn\\'t survive in this world with just an average amount.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAll the characters I had raised until now had at least one talent related to mana.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"How did I become a magician?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIt was difficult for someone to become a magician without a talent for mana in the first place.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIf someone without talent wanted to become a magician, they had to have an immense amount of money.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n...So, is that why the family went bankrupt?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI put that aside for now and moved on to the specialty.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nWhen you start the game, you are randomly given one specialty.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nOf course, there were trash-like specialties that were not useful, but there were also good specialties that could survive with just one.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIn the game, I used to start over and over again until I got a good specialty.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nBut here, in this reality, I couldn\\'t use such a trick.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n[Dual Core]</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n-Epic\\n\\n-You have two mana storages.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n-The possibility of becoming a magic swordsman opens up.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAn epic-grade specialty.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nOf course, just by looking at the grade, it was a top-tier specialty.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAnd a magic swordsman, how romantic and appealing it was.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Nonsense.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI\\'ve died dozens of times chasing after romance.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nHaven\\'t I tried it myself?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI\\'ve seen the ending 12 times.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIf I didn\\'t dig just one well, I couldn\\'t break through.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nResources and time were limited, and the ability to be raised was doubled, so the speed of getting stronger was slower.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nOn top of that, this place was not a game but reality.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAlthough the grace period before the crisis came was extended, the important thing was that this place was reality.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"No, on the contrary, since it\\'s reality, should I raise a low-level character?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Haah.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI could only let out a sigh.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI\\'ve never had a no-death clear in the game.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nEven with characters much better than Adrias, there was no no-death clear.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>How on earth could I survive?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIf it were a game, I could make a decision to dig just one well, whether I died or not.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But if my goal was survival, the Dual Core specialty didn\\'t seem bad.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI, now, didn\\'t aim for game clear, but survival.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIn the end, the specialty was left as a trap, so let\\'s look at the talent below.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Honestly, I didn\\'t even want to see it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Do you have a useless talent?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Even if you do, is it just another useless talent?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>A-class talent is simply written as \\'magic\\' in just two words.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Or something like \\'swordsmanship\\'.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It\\'s not good when the content becomes too long like that.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It means you only have talent in that specific field.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But even that, I\\'m just another useless talent.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Especially in the case of useless talent, it has the opposite effect rather than having nothing at all.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If an ordinary person is 100, a useless talent means 70 to 80.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\'Water magic is a gem disease.\\' I realized it here.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It seems like the world wants to kill me and went crazy.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The reason why Adrias died countless times in the early stages of the game must be because of these insignificant abilities.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Lastly, skills were an extension of talent.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If you had exceptional talent, you could quickly raise the proficiency and level of skills, but if you had no talent, no matter how hard you tried, it wouldn\\'t work, especially with magic skills.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>-Dark Magic: Basic Command (3/100)</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>&gt;&gt; Summon Skeleton LV1 -Elemental Magic: Beginner Earth Series (2/100)</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>&gt;&gt; Greece LV6, Rock Sphere LV3, Earth Shield LV5 Even though he was a third-year student at the academy, his proficiency in beginner-level elemental magic was astonishing, but he was only left with one elemental magic.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>When he realized that he had to show magical achievements to enter the Matop when he became a fifth-year student, it was obvious what his future would be like.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Oh, it was me, not him.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In the end, there was only one thing left for me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>-Ding!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>[There is an unselected trait.]</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Select trait.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Among the countless games I\\'ve played, I\\'ve never been able to choose traits as I pleased.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In this game, there were also elements of roguelike, so sometimes I could get traits when I defeated a mid-boss or achieved something, but they were all random.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I have to choose now to survive.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I returned to my dorm room and sat down on the chair, leaving the book behind.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And when the affirmative meaning was reflected in front of my eyes, the sentence changed.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>[Please choose the trait you want.]</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Hundreds of traits were listed in front of me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I carefully looked through the traits in the list.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>First, I selected all the normal and rare grade traits.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"There\\'s a trait like this?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I boasted that I had seen almost all the traits, but there were many things I had never found in epic or unique grades.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Especially unique traits were traits that could not be obtained even through game restarts, so except for two or three, they were all things I had never seen before.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And finally, one trait caught my eye strongly.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"This is....\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Without realizing it, my thoughts came out of my mouth.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And I pondered for a while.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>What is the best way for me to survive?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Is this really the best?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>How much resources and time do I have?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>What is the situation?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Hoo.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was difficult to make a decision easily because my life was at stake.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>There were piles of papers with notes that I had written while pondering in front of me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The conclusion that came out of there was...</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"In the end, I\\'m a necromancer.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It\\'s something I can\\'t deny.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Even if I don\\'t use it, I can\\'t erase what I\\'ve learned.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Then I have no choice but to use it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Only when my life is in danger.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Moreover, if a necromancer can grow safely, they are stronger than any other magician.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That\\'s why in the game, they were such a wicked existence that they would go and kill the necromancer first in every play.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"One of them is his master....</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Wait a minute.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I hurriedly checked the calendar.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I\\'m late.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Adrias\\' memories began to emerge.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I now remembered that I had promised to meet him last night.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was troublesome.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I won\\'t die...</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>probably.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I quickly put on the clothes I had taken off and prepared to go out.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I have to go find him now, or I\\'ll really die.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"But before that...\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I stopped thinking and chose the trait I had been thinking about.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Since it won\\'t solve anything even if I think about it for a few more days, I better get the trait and use it quickly.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Now that I\\'ve chosen the trait, my goal is to plan well and survive as much as possible.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And the next button for that goal will probably be where I\\'m going

response.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After a tense moment, I heard a small voice from behind the door.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Come in.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI cautiously opened the door.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Inside, a middle-aged man with neatly arranged black hair was sitting at his desk, examining a magic tablet.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>By the way, that magic tablet was a magic tool similar to a smartphone from the world I used to live in.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"...Adrias.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Yes, Professor.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Didn\\'t I clearly say 11 o\\'clock?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"I\\'m sorry.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I must have mistaken the date.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nHis cold gaze passed by me like a snake\\'s tongue.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nA slightly uncomfortable time passed, and he stood up from his seat.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Follow me.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAs soon as I answered, he touched a book on the bookshelf.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The bookshelf moved aside, revealing a barrier.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Open.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nWith a simple interaction of mana, the light emitted from his ring touched the barrier, gradually fading away as it recognized its owner.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAs I followed him into the barrier, I felt the smell of various potions and decaying bodies vibrating in the air.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Even though Adrias has seen this several times, he still seems uncomfortable.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIt was like entering a slaughterhouse, with all kinds of corpses scattered around.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>There were not only animal, monster, and human bodies, but also bodies of different races.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Huff.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI suppressed my frown.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As I followed Karone further inside, the corpses, which were quite neatly arranged, were hanging from chains.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"I should have done this yesterday, but it doesn\\'t matter.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nKarone muttered to himself as he magically lowered one of the bodies.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"What are you doing?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Are you still not in your right mind?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nWhen I just stared at the body, Karone spoke to me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThen, my body automatically started gathering unknown potions.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was a familiar movement, as if it had been engraved in my body.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"So this is how it\\'s done.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nMemories came back to me naturally.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nFirst, I sprinkled a little bit of Mandragora\\'s blood on the central floor as instructed.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThen, Karone used magic to construct a magic circle with the blood.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"About here...\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI scattered Torokan\\'s root powder on the circle.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAnd I placed cursed objects and potions in their appropriate positions as the medium....</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Etcha.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nOnce the body was placed in the center, it was done.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Was the process this complicated?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIn the game, I could just resurrect the corpses and summon undead with a single spell.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But now, it was already giving me a headache.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAfter the preparations were done, Karone arranged mana and created a magic formation.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAs I watched the process, I felt an inexplicable gaze from somewhere and turned around.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"....\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIn the area with iron bars, a thin woman with a gagged mouth was staring at me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was the memory that came to mind when I saw her.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"A vampire.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nNo, this bastard Karone was even keeping a vampire?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Unlike vampires in other games or media, the vampires of the Sinful Vampire were treated as one species.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>They didn\\'t die just by exposure to sunlight.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Instead, they were incredibly rare, and I had only seen vampires a handful of times in the game.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"And because of that, I had to do the rites.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nVampires were individually powerful.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Along with their strong bodies, their unique blood magic provided a perfect balance of offense and defense.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Karone was certainly a strong mid-boss-level talent, but that was only in the middle of the game.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nI was curious about how Karan was able to restrain the vampire.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"And when I killed Karan, there was no trace of the vampire.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nOf course, I couldn\\'t be sure if this space was reproduced in the game, but it was strange that nothing related to the vampire came up until I died.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Could it be that he failed to turn the undead into a vampire?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Even in Adrius\\' memories, there was no mention of anything related to the vampire.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>He only supplied the vampire with food about once a month.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As I carefully recalled my memories, an unexpected conclusion came to mind unrelated to the vampire.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Now that I think about it, I was completely fooled, wasn\\'t I?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Adrius.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Now that I think about it, he not only lacked talent, but also had a lot of gullible qualities.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In his memories, he hardly learned anything from Karan and only focused on following him.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After learning the basics of strategy in the beginning, he didn\\'t learn anything else.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Hmm.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>A sound that awakened me echoed from the magic circle.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The magic circle, which had been emitting a sinister red light, gradually absorbed mana and formed a spell formation.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Crack.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Crash.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As the light intensified, the flesh of the corpse that had been lying there turned to dust and crumbled.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>-Whoa.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>What should I call that?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>A zombie skeleton?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But as soon as I had that thought, the undead that had just appeared fell apart.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Failed.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Karan\\'s calm voice echoed.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After saying that, Karan started writing something in his notebook.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Is it over?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Did he only call me for this one thing?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Now that I think about it, I\\'ve been called for much less important things before.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>While cursing inwardly, my body diligently cleaned up the dirty room.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Adrius.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes, Professor.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"...Professor?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Sorry, Master.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>He\\'s not a master even though he hasn\\'t taught me anything.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But I sent him a loyal gaze like a quick-witted recruit.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"It seems like it\\'s been more than a month since Angela\\'s food supply.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Angela was the name of the vampire trapped in the cage.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes, I will take care of it after I finish cleaning.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Adrius.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I thought you had changed, but you\\'ve become even more foolish.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>With that, he left.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Did he notice that I\\'ve changed?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As I entered Adrius\\' body, I also changed from my original personality.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But even so, I seemed different from Adrius, which made me wonder.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"If I pay attention to such things, I\\'ll die sooner.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I continued cleaning while muttering to myself.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After all, I\\'m just a small fry.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Only Karan would care about my changes.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If Karan\\'s reaction was only that, there was no need to worry about Adrius\\' actions and think about his memories every time.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I tried using magic during cleaning, just in case.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>There happened to be remnants of a medium and a discarded magic circle, which was a perfect environment for me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>[Basic Command: Summon Skeleton.]</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>[Warning!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>There are no summonable creatures left.]</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Oh?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>When I tried to use magic, it was as if it was programmed and the mana arrangement automatically came to my mind.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>When I arranged the mana and then constructed the spell formation, a proper command was activated.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It felt like a special benefit for the player.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"This way, there won\\'t be much burden, right?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Honestly, when I was planning in my room, I had a lot of worries about whether I had to learn the basics of magic again, even for dark magic.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In the end, I had to learn from scratch, even if it was for dark magic.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Generally, you can\\'t self-study dark magic.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It wasn\\'t for any particular reason, it was just that there was no way to learn the related knowledge.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In this world, dark magic was forbidden, so it was secretly passed down in the shadows.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If there were widely spread books or materials, I would have tried self-study, but there were no dark magic books.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>...Of course, this is the story of ordinary people.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I had the conditions to self-study.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"There are widely spread dark magic books here.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was the first growth plan I made.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That was Karan\\'s dark magic books.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Anyway, until I become strong, I can\\'t cut ties with Karan.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Then I should use him as much as possible.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Those were Karan\\'s belongings that I didn\\'t even think of touching as the original Adrius.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After finishing cleaning, I checked the items in the laboratory.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Even so, I quickly understood what was what.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Even if I use them little by little, it won\\'t be noticeable, right?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I soon examined the dark magic books that filled one side of the laboratory wall.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Introduction to Dark Magic, Basic Lecture for Dark Mages, You Can Do It.\\n\"Do dark magic!\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I took out the books that seemed to have a slightly makeshift feel compared to the ones I saw at the academy, but they were the most basic ones for now.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As I prepared to read the books in earnest, I felt a piercing gaze on me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Ah.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>When my eyes met with Angela, the vampire, I awkwardly scratched the back of my head and stood up from my seat.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Oh, I forgot to feed her.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Her meal wasn\\'t anything special.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>There was already plenty of blood from the widely spread corpses, and I only needed to give her a little bit of blood.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Following Adrius\\' memory, I brought a long hose and put it in a container filled with blood, passing it through the iron bars.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, the amount of blood wasn\\'t much.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Just enough to keep her from starving to death?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That\\'s when I heard a cracked voice.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"You...\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As I handed her the hose, I raised my head, wondering if I misheard something.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Did I mishear?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Still unsure, I asked Angela.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"What did you just say?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I didn\\'t remember her ever speaking.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Even though I spent over two years under Karon, she had never spoken before.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But she just stared at the hose in my hand, as if asking when she said it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I\\'m pretty sure she said something.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As I handed her the hose from a distance, she struggled to approach and sucked on the hose.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I don\\'t know how she got caught, but her will to survive was impressive.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After resolving her meal, I calmly started reading the book again, but I heard the voice once more.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Adrius.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>When I turned around, I saw her crimson eyes staring at me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"You\\'re not Adrius.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Who are you?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It wasn\\'t a mistake.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>My whole body froze as a chill ran down my spine.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But I calmly opened my mouth without showing any signs.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If I\\'m not Adrius, then who am I?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"If you were Adrius, you would have been flustered when I spoke.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Are you going crazy after being trapped here for so long?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>What do you want to say?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n

you doubt.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That should be enough.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Indeed.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If the guy who hadn\\'t said a word all this time suddenly started suspecting my true identity, it could be suspicious.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"It\\'s better to let you go than to die.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Are you afraid of dying from him?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"That\\'s not the only reason, but even if I don\\'t believe you, I can still make you doubt.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That should be enough.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Certainly.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After the guy mentioned that Karon seemed to have changed, it bothered me even more.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I closed the book and put it back in place, then stood in front of the iron bars.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Alright.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Have you made up your mind?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I can\\'t open this iron bar.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"That\\'s not a problem.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Just release this restraint.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Releasing the restraint also required magical dismantling.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Before I could think about whether I could do it or not, I demanded a definite answer.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Before that, swear that you won\\'t kill me.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Alright, I swear.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n

way.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Although I said that, I was honestly skeptical.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Vampires have only one family.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And anyone would sacrifice their family\\'s name for something as life-threatening as this.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>So, there was no surefire way to confirm their sincerity.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"...\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But unexpectedly, Angela hesitated.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Why are you hesitating even though it\\'s just a verbal oath?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Honestly, even if she made the oath, I had no intention of releasing her.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I just wanted to buy some time to think.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After thinking for a long time, Angela finally opened her mouth.</p>\\n

<br/>\\n    <p>It seemed like it would take this long.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But for now, I was grateful for the time I had gained.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I had to leave my place empty for the task Karone had given me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I didn\\'t know what Angela might say to Karone during this time.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was better to have her in this unconscious state to avoid such worries.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nWhen I checked the time, it was already late at night.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I quickly organized everything, checked Angela once again, and returned to my dorm room.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nOnce I returned to my room, I immediately checked my schedule.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Of all times...\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIf I wanted to go to the Empty Hartz National Cemetery as Karone instructed, I had to leave right away.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The problem was that I might have to skip classes the next afternoon.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Do I really need to die or not?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Are these lectures that important?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nTo be honest, they were important.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Very important.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAs you know, the Adrius family is in a dire financial situation, with debts and barely enough wealth.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In this difficult life, I was fortunate enough to be selected as a scholarship recipient due to the passing of my ancestor, the former Viscount.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThanks to that, I was able to barely cover the tuition with the scholarship benefits.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If I were to skip classes without permission, even that might disappear.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nMy head was complicated, but my body was already prepared to go out.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I even brought a disguise outfit just in case and dragged my luggage.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Let\\'s resolve this as quickly as possible.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If I\\'m lucky, I might be able to return by tomorrow afternoon.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAfter planning my route in my head, I immediately took action.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIt was late at night, so there was not a single person passing by outside.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>However, the mana railway station near the academy, which operated 24 hours, was still brightly lit.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Ah.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nWhen I took out my wallet to calculate the ticket cost, I realized that I only had enough money to buy a round trip ticket.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"That damn Karone.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>At least he should give me some pocket money for running errands.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI cursed him silently and paid for the ticket before boarding the mana express train.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nCome to think of it, Karone had never given me any money even though he had asked me to do errands for him.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It seemed like he thought it was only natural for me to pay since I was learning dark magic for free.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But I was different.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"After I come back this time, I\\'ll at least bring it up.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I don\\'t even have money for food.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI stared blankly at the boxed lunches being sold on the train and only satisfied my appetite.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nDuring the train ride, I took a short break and read the book I had brought.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was borrowed from the library the previous day.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"I don\\'t understand what all this nonsense is about.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nBut I forced myself to read it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI had to familiarize myself with the words and terms, even if it meant forcing my brain awake.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After about six hours, I arrived at the Heartbell Station, where the national cemetery was located.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As soon as I got off, I headed straight towards the cemetery.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In truth, I wanted to take a carriage near the station, but I didn\\'t have any money.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Damn money.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I need to solve this money problem first.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In the game, I rarely had to worry about money.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I simply used my character\\'s skills to earn money, but now I had no skills or talents, so I had to find another way.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Fortunately, I had memorized various things while playing the game, and even as a character like Adrias with no special traits, there were still ways.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"The problem is that I don\\'t even have initial funds.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The more I thought about it, the more pathetic my character seemed.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But what could I do?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>This is who I am now.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Since I was in a hurry to go back, I ran with all my strength, dragging my luggage all the way to the cemetery.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And less than five minutes later, I felt my breath running out.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I should exercise regularly if I want to survive.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Stamina is essential to survive.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But my stamina was low, as if I were a wizard.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>No, if that\\'s the case, I should at least have a talent for magic.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After a fierce battle that lasted almost an hour, I barely managed to reach the entrance of the cemetery.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The sky was already dawn.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I came from the Jenis residence.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I\\'m the third grandson.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Did you bring the flowers?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I brought 13 blue sky butterfly flowers.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Good.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Go in.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After exchanging the designated greetings with the gatekeeper, I entered.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The society of dark wizards may have been hidden in the shadows, but their power was by no means small.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>This empty Hartz National Cemetery was already one of the places bought by the dark wizards.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As I passed through the main gate and entered inside, I saw hundreds of tombstones and one cemetery worker in the spacious outdoors.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I immediately approached the cemetery worker who was working.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Mr. Pyreman.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Are you running an errand for Caron?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>You came early.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>You mentioned Bayden\\'s tomb.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I\\'ve already prepared it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It should be over there.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As if he had already received the message, he pointed in a direction where a coffin that hadn\\'t been buried yet could be seen.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Or maybe it was a coffin that had already been buried and dug up.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Thank you.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As I said that, I noticed the identity of the corpse that the cemetery worker was working on.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Lifheal!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Nickel Lifheal!\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was actually one of the Easter eggs in the game.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The story goes like this: A man who idolized Ora Master suddenly started training with a sword for decades.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Cutting off worldly ties, he trained with the sword without missing a day.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Eventually, he became an Ora Master, but the moment he became an Ora Master, he died from overexertion.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It\\'s a strange story of a plain man without talent for the sword finally becoming an Ora Master and dying.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Ora Masters in this world are truly monsters beyond human comprehension.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It\\'s ridiculous that he became a monster and died instantly.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That\\'s why it\\'s called an Easter egg.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And this Easter egg is ultimately just a reference to the story of Cadreus.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But why bother creating such an Easter egg?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"It must mean that he was a real Ora Master.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Otherwise, why would they go through so much trouble to create an Easter egg like this?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>However, since it was a useless Easter egg, I didn\\'t pay much attention to it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Even I, who played the game meticulously, couldn\\'t immediately recall\\nI couldn\\'t do it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"But Nickel Lifehill...\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>My heart pounded.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The fact that Nickel Lifehill had become an Overmaster was not officially known, as he had died without any official announcement.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>He was only known through rumors in the village where he lived.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Honestly, it was an unimaginable death considering the image of an Overmaster.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That\\'s why the value of this corpse is probably unknown to anyone.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"The abilities of a summoned creature resurrected by necromancy are proportional to their abilities in their previous life.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If I were to create something like a Death Knight with this...\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, even Karone can\\'t create a top-tier summon like a Death Knight right now.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But it was obvious that if I were to create something like a skeleton with this, its level would far surpass that of an ordinary skeleton.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Just as I was about to pass by naturally, the gravedigger, wiping the sweat from his forehead, looked at me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Are you done?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes, I\\'ve finished.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Good.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Say hello to Karone for me.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes, Mr. Pyman.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As I was about to pass by naturally, I threw a glance at him.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Oh, by the way.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Huh?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>What is it?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Is there any way I can get assigned a corpse to make my own summon?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Maybe?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Hmm.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>How many years has it been for you?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"It\\'s been three years now.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Ha!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>You\\'re still a fledgling with a lot of ambition.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Is that so?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Haha.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As I pretended to laugh coolly, he wiped the sweat from his forehead once again and said.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I understand how you feel, but first, get permission from Karone.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That\\'s the fastest way.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Of course, that makes sense.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I understand.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Thank you for your advice.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>...Did you think I would say that?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I had already discovered the corpse of an Overmaster, and not just anyone, but a corpse that no one would even suspect to be an Overmaster.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I couldn\\'t let it go like this.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I hesitated for a moment, but ultimately made a decision.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Taking off the ring I had in my hand, I said to Pyman.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Mr. Pyman.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Why again?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Aren\\'t you going?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Can I take this corpse with me if I use this ring?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Pyman\\'s eyes widened at the ring I held out to him.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But in an instant, he hid his emotions and spoke as if nothing had happened.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"As I said earlier, you can\\'t do it without Karone\\'s permission.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If I were to give you a corpse and it was found out by that guy, I would be in a difficult position too.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"You don\\'t have to worry about that.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I can manage it without getting caught.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Hmm.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Is that so?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It\\'s still a little awkward...\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Please, Mr. Pyman.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I have nothing but this ring.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But as a dark magician, achieving my goal is my priority.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Please accept it.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Oh, this shouldn\\'t be happening...\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In the end, he pretended to give in and accepted my ring.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>He probably thought he had completely fooled me, right?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Well, that ring was the signet ring of Count Cromwell, a noble family with three generations of power.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"It\\'s just a ring.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I can earn money and get it back later.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Right now, securing any resources I can get my hands on is a priority.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Anyway, I was planning to exchange that ring for money in the first place.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It would be much more profitable to use that money to obtain the corpse of an Overmaster.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Alright.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>You said you wanted this corpse, right?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Take it.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Thank you.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>We both hid our true intentions and took advantage of each other.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Pyman was probably delighted to sell the corpse of an ordinary old man at a high price, even though he wasn\\'t a young knight.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Although the Cromwell family was a noble family with three generations of power, it was still just a signet ring, so it would fetch a high price.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Still, compared to the corpse of an Overmaster, it was like a drop in the bucket.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Money can\\'t buy something like that, even if you have a lot of it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If people knew it was the corpse of an Overmaster, they would grab their throats and collapse.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>When I opened the coffin and saw the old man who looked like he had died recently with his eyes closed.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I entrust this to you, my first subordinate.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I carefully took out the corpse as if handling a baby.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was exhausting, but to me, it was something that couldn\\'t be compared to any treasure.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I could only smile.</p>\\n

immediately returned to the academy.</h1>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As soon as I arrived, I left my suitcase in the room and ran without even wiping off my sweat.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I barely made it to class on time by dragging my exhausted body, which was screaming that it couldn\\'t do it anymore, with my mental strength.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nTak!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Hmm?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Sorry for being late.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Huh, huh.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Although I was about 10 minutes late, my efforts seemed to have gone unnoticed by the professor, who resumed the class without paying any attention to it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Despite attracting some attention by forcefully opening the door, I ignored it and sat in an empty seat.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAnd as expected, the curious gazes that were directed at me faded away in less than five seconds.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"It\\'s nice to be popular.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I almost got dust in my eyes for a moment, but I decided to just let it go.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"...As you all know, the Mahaim leaf has excellent nourishing effects, but if the intake exceeds a certain threshold, it becomes a chronic poison.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>This poison induces headaches along with hallucinogenic effects, but it can be utilized...\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Intermediate Herbology by Professor Bevan.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The relationship between magicians and herbs is inseparable.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Herbs are essential experimental materials and mediators in dealing with numerous potions and magical tools.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, not only herbs but also various other ingredients, such as monster byproducts, are used, but herbs had the advantage of being relatively inexpensive compared to other ingredients.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, the prices of rare herbs were ridiculously high, but let\\'s put that aside for now.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Even in the game, even if you weren\\'t a magician, you had to memorize the names and combination methods of herbs for doping potions and recovery potions.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"For example, if you mix the Mahaim leaf with three additional ingredients, you can create an excellent stamina-boosting potion.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>While listening to the professor\\'s words, I realized that something was off.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Three ingredients?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Wasn\\'t it six?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In the game, it took seven ingredients, including the Mahaim leaf, to create a stamina-boosting potion.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Adding only three ingredients meant it was a temporary stamina-boosting stimulant, which was even worse than a debuff that caused a decrease in stats once the buff wore off.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>No one seemed to question it, so I ended up speaking up.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I couldn\\'t resist my curiosity.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Um, Professor!\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Hmm?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>What is it?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Are the three ingredients you mentioned the Jahas fruit, Todor Tree sap, and Mel fruit?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes, that\\'s right.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Are the Honfisi sap or Matarata root bark not included?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Huh.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Why would those be included?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If you want to know, try it yourself.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The professor sarcastically replied, and the laughter of the students spread as if they were mocking me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I was momentarily taken aback, but I thanked him and took my seat without showing any signs of it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Why is it different from the game?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If it wasn\\'t something else...</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Could it be that the combination method hadn\\'t been discovered yet?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The thought sent shivers down my spine.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I should go to the library as soon as the class is over.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I wanted to check the book that listed the types of potions and reagents.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If there were specialized books for my major, I could have checked those, but as a slacker like Adrias, I had never bought a single book.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Finally, after the class ended, I headed straight to the library, but someone called out to me and stopped me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Senpai.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>At first, I thought it wasn\\'t me who was being called, so I walked out, but when I heard the voice again, I stopped in my tracks.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Adrias Cromwell senpai.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Addressing me by my full name, the girl with sleepy eyes looked at me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>A gust of wind blew, and her pinkish white short hair fluttered like cherry blossoms.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I barely managed to relax my stiff face when I realized who she was.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Lucia Everlast.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The girl with a mysterious atmosphere and drowsy eyes had come closer to me without me noticing.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I have a question to ask you.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"What is it?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I didn\\'t know why she called me, but I found myself getting nervous.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Perhaps my awkwardness seemed strange to her, as Lucia tilted her head slightly, but she quickly ignored it and asked her question.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Why did you ask that question earlier?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I never expected her to be in the same class.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was still early in the semester, and Adrias had only become a student recently, so I didn\\'t know much about the situation around me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Come to think of it, if she wasn\\'t a freshman, she would have had a reason to take an advanced herbology class.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Oh, it\\'s just...</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I thought it would suit you well.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Honfisi, huh?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Honestly, I can understand to some extent up to Matarata, but why did you suddenly mention Honfisi?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That combination method was the result of my efforts.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>This unfriendly game didn\\'t provide any information other than basic combination methods.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>One day, I took the time and mixed various random items for a week.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Fortunately, there was a system in the game that provided hints when items were mixed, even if the combination failed.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The combination methods that are now in my head were completed based on those hints.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I came up with it because of the Mohaim fruit.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Why did the Mohaim fruit suddenly come up?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"As you know, the Mohaim fruit has much stronger effects than its leaves, but it also has more side effects.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And one of those side effects is similar to highly addictive drugs.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"But...\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"To neutralize it, I needed the bark of the Matarahta root that I mentioned earlier.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But I couldn\\'t completely remove it, so I thought the Honpishi would be perfect for neutralizing it.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"So, senior, do you think you can make a stamina potion with the fruit?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I\\'m not sure.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I couldn\\'t say anything more.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>This could be a money-making opportunity for me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, there are dozens, hundreds of other combination methods.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I can\\'t remember them all, but I should write down the ones I can remember somewhere.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Honpishi...\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>When I suddenly saw her lost in thought, I wondered if I had said too much.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was a random thought, but seeing the character that I had seen with low-quality graphics in the game now in live-action was mind-blowing.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In the game, it was so pixelated, but in reality, it was like slapping a celebrity\\'s face.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Along with that random thought, a faint memory came to mind.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Ah, you must have had a hard time too.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>She was the character I raised as the third, or rather, the last wizard.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>She was the ninth character overall.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The difficulty level was extreme.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Her talent was extraordinary, to the point where people would say she was crazy.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Just a little training would greatly increase her mana and skill proficiency, and watching her progress, the obstacles that had blocked her were easily overcome.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In terms of talent alone, she was probably superior to Dienne, whom I encountered the day before.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But why was her difficulty level so extreme...</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Hmm?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>You\\'re still here?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>You can leave now.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I\\'m done with what I needed from you.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Alright.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Take care.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Are all geniuses so arrogant?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But I didn\\'t want to show my dislike, so I smiled and left.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It didn\\'t matter anyway, as she would probably die within a few years.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The reason for her high difficulty level was none other than an incurable disease.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"She was the character I played with the most.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>No, to be precise, not just played, but started a completely new game.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I counted up to the twentieth time I started anew, but after that, I gave up counting.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That\\'s how difficult her treatment was, even for me now...</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Wait a moment...\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As I thought about it, a possibility came to mind.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I might be able to save her.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Because I already had the experience of clearing the game.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>She was the reason I had to come up with hundreds of combination methods.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Her treatment was difficult because finding the combination method was challenging, but if I had the ingredients, it could be easily solved.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Of course, the ingredients are not easy to obtain either.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But it\\'s true that I can save her if I know the combination method.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The problem was what would happen once I saved her.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"When I played, I definitely killed Adrias.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If I couldn\\'t cure the disease, she would die before harming Adrias.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But if I cured the disease, it would be her who would harm Adrias.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Lost in thought, I suddenly arrived at the library.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Where can I find books on potions and reagents?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Oh, if you\\'re talking about that, they were just returned.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Here.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It seemed someone had brought them to the herbology class.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>They must have returned them right after the lecture ended.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I wanted to check the books right away, but I had something to do before that.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I should go see the self-proclaimed master.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I should hurry and hand over the corpse and do what I need to do.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>When I arrived, Karen\\'s lecture was still ongoing.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Thanks to that, I had some time left and could eat the school cafeteria food with the coupon I had pre-purchased.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Adrias.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes, Professor.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"You smell.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"What?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"You smell like food.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It\\'s disgusting.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"...I\\'m sorry.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Why does this crazy guy start a fight as soon as he sees me?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I mean, I only drink dew.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Does he think I eat something else?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Karen continued to speak without looking away from his book, but he glanced at the carrier bag I brought.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I said I\\'ll give you two days, did you already bring it?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I thought it meant yesterday and today were the two days, but it seems like it wasn\\'t the case.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Well, considering the time, it was too early to bring it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Karen, who kept talking, glanced at the carrier bag I brought.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I\\'ll take a look at it later.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Okay.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I had something to do before checking the books anyway.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I should go see the so-called master.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I should hurry and hand over the corpse and do what I need to do.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I didn\\'t have any money.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Karon closed the book without saying a word and got up from his seat.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Follow me.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Just like the previous day, we walked through the barrier and entered the research lab.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As soon as we entered, Karon immediately ordered me to retrieve the corpses.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The inside of the carrier, which had a space expansion magic on it, was pitch dark and nothing could be seen.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I reached out my hand and pulled out the larger of the two corpses that could be felt.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Kkungcha.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was definitely the body of a young knight, so it was bulky and heavy.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As I struggled to retrieve the corpse, Karon stood silently, stroking his chin, lost in thought.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>While he was silent, I glanced at Angela, just in case.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>- Kuuul....</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>She looks very pleased.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>At least nothing went wrong, thankfully.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If she had been harmed, even without evidence that I was responsible, she would have become an experimental subject due to Karon\\'s anger.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"His condition is better than I thought.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I\\'ll turn him into a chimera undead.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>At the word chimera, my body reflexively resisted.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, it wasn\\'t because of an upset stomach or anything, but because I had a lot of things to do.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Fortunately, it wasn\\'t something that had to be done immediately.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It required a period of applying various reagents to the knight\\'s corpse and allowing it to mature.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, I had to do most of the work myself.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Time has already passed like this.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>While I was working, Karon, who was playing with the reagents next to me, said.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Then, without saying a word, he left the research lab.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"When you\\'re done, place it on the magic circle I made and activate the spell.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>With the voice that faintly echoed from the office connected to the research lab, the research lab closed.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Haah.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>This bastard.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>He orders me around without giving me a single penny.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Oh, money!\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I realized that I had forgotten the train fare.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Next time, I must remember to mention it and tear it up.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I finished my work meticulously and activated the magic circle.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Then, I stretched and yawned, seeing the ominous energy emitting from it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I endured the fatigue that came from overexerting my body for two days with my mental strength.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Ah.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Just as I was about to read the dark magic book, I remembered the remaining nickel in the carrier.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Should I make it now?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The storage method would be a problem if I made it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I didn\\'t have any experience raising necromancers, so I didn\\'t know for sure, but I often saw them storing the creatures in another dimension and summoning them when needed...</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Do I have another dimension too?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After all, spatial magic could only be used by high-level magicians.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I thought for a moment and decided that if it didn\\'t work, I would just store it in the carrier.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It wouldn\\'t matter if it was stored as a corpse.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Karon wouldn\\'t check anyway.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As I pulled out Nickel\\'s corpse, an old man with a courteous demeanor appeared.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>When I saw his body, I had some doubts.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Is it really Master Oller?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I wondered if I had mistaken something.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If it was a mistake, then I had used an incredible amount of mana for nothing.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"No, it can\\'t be.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Easter eggs can\\'t be fake.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Trust me and trust the game.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>...Thinking like this, neither side seemed reliable, and I felt a little discouraged.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I felt a little regretful as I tried to use the necromancy.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If my necromancy level was high, I could summon something other than a regular skeleton, like a Durahan or a Dark Warrior, or even a Ghoul.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That\\'s why most necromancers store exceptional corpses instead of using them.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Now is not the time to be picky.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Besides, I chose this trait with this situation in mind.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If it evolves, it will somehow resolve it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Still, I added Karon\\'s reagents and some other ingredients without showing any signs of it, with the determination to do what I could.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>[Basic Necromancy:

   <h1>Episode 6: Possibility, Money, and Family\\nSkeleton Soldier.</h1>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>A Tier 2 skeleton.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was a skeleton that could only appear after reaching the intermediate command level, which was the next step after the basics.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"As expected, the Easter Egg was true.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The skeleton soldier stood up from its seat and examined its body as if it were human.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The creature carefully inspected its arms and legs, moving them around as if to check its physical abilities.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Meanwhile, I checked its information.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>[Skeleton Soldier (Legendary)]</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>- Nickel Lifethill\\n- Undead\\n- Tier 2\\n- Special Ability: Self/Apex: Swordsmanship\\nApex.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I couldn\\'t have imagined that a skeleton would have a skill like that.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I had only seen this skill when I had leveled up my playable character to the late stages of the game.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was a unique skill that could only be obtained through growth.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was a skill that received various bonuses related to the Apex attribute.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"He\\'s just a Tier 2 skeleton soldier, but to have the Apex attribute...</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I wonder how strong he is.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Since I had never raised a necromancer character, I honestly couldn\\'t tell.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, I had encountered them as enemies in the game.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But even among the warlocks, necromancers were rare, so I hadn\\'t encountered them that often.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Necromancers are frowned upon even among warlocks.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I couldn\\'t understand why Adrias had chosen such a thorny path.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>When I recalled my memories, it was right after the death of the first Count Cromwell.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"He probably did it to escape from reality.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Karon\\'s sharp tongue had played a part as well.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>He was excellent at gently provoking Adrias when his father passed away and his heart weakened.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That quiet and cold-blooded guy was surprisingly talkative when it came to provoking Adrias.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Well, in the end, I became like his servant.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Most of the reasons why Adrias died were because he played the role of obstructing the players who interfered with Karon\\'s plans.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Otherwise, he died while obstructing players who tried to interfere with Karon.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Regardless of the details, the conclusion is the same.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If I wanted to survive, I had to get away from Karon.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>There could be various methods, but the top priority was to become stronger.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Just then, the skeleton soldier finished examining its body and approached me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes, I am your master.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Calling it a skeleton soldier felt a bit strange.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Moreover, it wasn\\'t an ordinary skeleton, but the legendary Orma Master.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Since it had turned out like this, let\\'s call him Nickel from now on.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Nice to meet you, Nickel.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>- Click!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Click!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I didn\\'t know what it was saying, but it felt positive.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As Nickel continued to move its jaw, it suddenly started drawing something in the air.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Writing?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Understood, I will do as you ask.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>- Click, click, click, click!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Seeing the skull mask nodding solemnly, I couldn\\'t help but laugh.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The fact that even a skeleton could express its intentions.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Even Moron, who was currently the strongest necromancer, probably wouldn\\'t believe it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes, as the greatest Orma Master in the world, I should do that much.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Although it\\'s unfair for you to die right after becoming an Orma Master, try to become famous even under my command.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, even if you became famous under my command, it would only increase your notoriety.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Nickel nodded in response to my words and formed a circle by touching its index finger and thumb together.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Even that serious gesture seemed like a comedy.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I didn\\'t know what its true thoughts were, but it was clear that it showed favor to me, the summoner.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Now that Nickel has been summoned successfully, let\\'s tidy up and go.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>[There are currently 0/5 summoning slots available.]</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>[Would you like to dismiss one Skeleton Soldier?]</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As soon as I thought about putting Nickel back in the carrier, a familiar message appeared.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"What?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Are necromancers classified as summoners too?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was a familiar message because I had played as a summoner before.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It\\'s not like I have to hide it if I\\'m classified as a summoner.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I immediately dismissed Nickel.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Then, a black space appeared in the air, swallowing Nickel and making him disappear.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I wonder if summoning is possible now?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>[There are currently 1/5 summoning slots available.]</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>[Would you like to summon one Skeleton Soldier?]</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I summoned Nickel again, and he appeared as if nothing had happened.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"But my mana has been depleted.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Summoning was cost-free when dismissing, but it consumed mana when summoning.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After this summoning, my mana was completely drained.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Thanks to this, the possibility of survival has increased.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As long as I don\\'t get caught, the risk of death will decrease.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I thought it might be a special benefit for players, but come to think of it, other necromancers had also summoned undead creatures from thin air.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>They had summoned creatures much stronger than resurrecting dead bodies, so it seemed that this summoning space was a common ability for all necromancers.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Before leaving the lab, I checked on Angela\\'s condition.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>She seemed to be deeply asleep and couldn\\'t wake up, and there were about 147 hours left.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Even when I returned to the dormitory, I worried about what to do if she woke up, but worrying wouldn\\'t solve anything, so I read a book I brought from the library.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Continental Forces 284th Edition, Effects and Types of Magical Chemicals and Their Combinations.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>What a weird name.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was a book that made me think living was difficult.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Looking at the thickness, it seems like there should be everything....\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I felt a little uneasy, but I opened the book anyway.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And I nodded my head.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"There are so many complicated words.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The book gets thicker when it\\'s written like this.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But there were also parts that made me admire.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Roughly skimming through, I found that 90% of the combinations I didn\\'t know about were there.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It\\'s probably because history is history, there must be many combination methods that I don\\'t know.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"But this is a bit....\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The problem was that more than half of those combinations were practically useless.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Why would they make a potion that makes the blood vessels in your eyes more visible when you drink it?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That was basic.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>There were even combinations that had no effect and just smelled like goblin feces, and potions that gave a burning sensation when applied to the skin.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Even if I had found these in the game, I wouldn\\'t have remembered them.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Fortunately, there were no good effects, like the doping potions I often made, for example.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Although there should be, I realized that in the game, only miscellaneous items that would help the player were dropped.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In other words, in this world, where there are too many combinations, even more bizarre combinations are created.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Just take the horn for example.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>From scales to flesh, bones, internal organs, and even horns, there were so many things I could try.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But in the game, only the horn was dropped.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"In the end, I can eat almost anything.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The calm and composed Kim Jin-hwan, where did he go?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>My body trembled with excitement.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Stay calm.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It\\'s not over until it\\'s over.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, it was a combination method that only I knew, but until I applied for a patent, I couldn\\'t relax.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If I tried to apply for a patent, someone like Karon could interfere.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"In the end, it\\'s a world where power is everything.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It\\'s a world where the weak can\\'t even raise their voice.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>To protect my rights, I needed to prepare.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"For now, just one.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Let\\'s try just one thing.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If I show something too outstanding, there will definitely be noise.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Until I have enough power, I should stay quiet.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Luckily, the stamina-boosting potion I learned in class today was perfect.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was easy to make as a basic doping item, and it had good cost performance.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And it wasn\\'t too outstanding compared to what I already had.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Then, first, I need money to buy the ingredients....\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I don\\'t have any money?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>To earn money, you need money.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It\\'s an absurdity.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>When I was thinking about it for a long time, I remembered a place where I could borrow money.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Maybe it\\'s time to use the family chance.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Amy Cromwell.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I had a great younger sister.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The capital of the empire, Rodren.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was a distance that could be reached in an hour by taking a train from the station near the academy.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After getting off the train and walking a little, I could quickly reach my destination.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The store where I heard Amy was working was grand yet elegant.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As I entered, the glamorous chandeliers brightly illuminated the sophisticated atmosphere inside.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Welcome.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>How many people are you?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The woman greeted me with a bright smile, and I awkwardly smiled back.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I came to meet someone I know.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Is there an employee named Amy here?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Amy?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>May I ask who you are?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I\\'m her older brother.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>When I answered, the woman smiled as if she had been waiting for it and disappeared, saying she would wait for a moment.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I want to leave quickly.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>This glamorous space didn\\'t suit me at all.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I had only heard stories and never actually visited the place where my younger sister worked.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was ironic that I could have come here easily, but I hadn\\'t come until now.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Looking around, there were wealthy ladies and young women chatting while enjoying refreshments.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Among them, I felt like a clean dish in the middle of a plate stained with filth, just standing there dumbfounded.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Oppa?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Amy, wearing the store uniform, approached from the other side.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>She had a superior appearance to the point where I wondered if we were really siblings, and she tilted her head slightly as she stood in front of me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Let\\'s go to the employee break room first, Oppa.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Okay.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In the lounge where I entered with Amy, I stayed silent, unable to bring myself to say what I wanted to say.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Facing her, I felt ashamed.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>No, think about it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The daughter of a countess was struggling to work part-time.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>How could a noblewoman like her work while listening to other people\\'s complaints?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If she were a maid working in the royal palace, she wouldn\\'t have to say a word.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>This place was a shop that anyone could visit as long as they had money.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But could I, the author who suddenly appeared, easily ask her to lend me money?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Especially when I was just a guy who wrote instead of earning money while attending the academy.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"But I can\\'t just give up on the academy....\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I had made up my mind to become stronger, and studying magic and training at the academy was the fastest way.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Although I was a third-year student and had to prepare for graduation in about two more years.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"What\\'s wrong?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It\\'s been a while since we last saw each other, right?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Amy looked at me with sparkling eyes.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Come to think of it, it was always like this.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>This guy always stood by my side and supported me, no matter what stupid things Adrias did.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Ah, it feels like guilt is about to burst out of my mouth.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I\\'m sorry.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I couldn\\'t take care of you often.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Huh?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Um, um....\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Amy replied with a confused expression, as if my words were sudden.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But soon, her expression turned suspicious.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"What do you want to ask me this time?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Ah, well.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It\\'s just that I need some money....\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I couldn\\'t continue speaking any longer.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Self-disgust and guilt surged up like they were piercing the sky.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I can\\'t just ask Amy for help in this way.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Ah, forget it, Amy.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It\\'s just something I thought of, forget it.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Why are you acting so unlike yourself?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Just wait a moment.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Ah, Amy.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It\\'s okay.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Don\\'t worry about it, just go.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As she left the lounge, I folded my outstretched hand in despair.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I have to find another way, I just can\\'t bring myself to ask Amy for help.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Sigh.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That\\'s right.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Just forget it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Don\\'t go starving yourself somewhere.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>When her gaze fell on my hand, I suddenly felt a strong emotion welling up inside me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was a mix of anger towards myself and guilt towards Amy.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Phew.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I barely suppressed my emotions and took the money she handed me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Thank you.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I\\'ll definitely pay you back as soon as possible.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"It\\'s fine.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>You don\\'t have to.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Just don\\'t go starving somewhere.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Then, her gaze fell on my hand.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Oppa?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yeah, what?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Where\\'s the ring?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"....\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>What should I say?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>When I hesitated for a moment, Amy\\'s eyes grew wider.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The atmosphere was not good.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"No, you didn\\'t, right?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Please tell me you didn\\'t lose the ring.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>She grabbed my arm and shook her head.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"No, right?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Just tell me it\\'s not true.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Where is the ring now?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Amy.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Tell me quickly!\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Well....\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>How could I tell her that I used it to buy a corpse?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I couldn\\'t bring myself to answer.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"....Leave.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I\\'m sorry.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Leave.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Get out right now.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And don\\'t ever come back.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>You don\\'t even have to return the money.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I\\'ll get it back soon...\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Clang!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Amy didn\\'t listen to my excuses and left the lounge.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The Amy in my memories had never been so angry before.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>My chest ached.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Was this emotion Kim Jin-hwan\\'s or Adrias\\'s?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Sigh.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>My chest felt

becoming court wizards, most magicians wanted to enter prestigious magic towers or families.</h1>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The biggest reason was money.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Just like any other family, the research and experiments of magicians required a substantial amount of wealth.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And the higher the tower\\'s reputation, they not only received immense sponsorship and donations from nobles but also from the country itself.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nOne could argue that it was like pouring water into a broken jar, but if done properly, it could change the entire country\\'s level.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>For example, there were mana-boosting trains installed throughout the empire.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Thanks to them, travel time was significantly reduced, leading to a logistics revolution.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Additionally, magic towers played a crucial role in various aspects of daily life, such as illuminating the streets at night with mana lamps, extending people\\'s active hours, and developing fertilizer from the remains of mythical creatures like Pophus to solve food problems.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nHowever, what I wanted to say was this: while magical research could bring significant profits upon success, until then, it was just a money-eating beast.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Damn it.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I muttered in frustration as I looked at another failed potion.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The remaining combination materials were pitifully laid out next to me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If I used them all, I would only have enough money left to restock once.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"I received quite a bit of money.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I underestimated the cost of materials.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I thought to myself.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI thought making a stamina-increasing potion would be a piece of cake.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But what now?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"The combination ratios of each ingredient weren\\'t implemented in the game.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In the game, you just put the items listed in the combination recipe and pressed the combine button to get the results.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>However, in reality, the quantity and ratio of each ingredient were crucial.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIt had been two days since I started trying, but I was still failing continuously.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Checking the time, I realized it was time to close the laboratory.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIn the end, I packed the materials into my backpack and finished up.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Should I increase the ratio of leaves rather than Mahaim fruit?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>No, considering the side effects that are still occurring, the neutralizing ingredient might be...\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I murmured to myself as I looked at the notes I made about the experiment\\'s results.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nJust as I was about to leave, someone from the adjacent laboratory opened the door at the same time as me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Oh?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Senior.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Lucia, with her short pink hair, waved her hand cheerfully as her eyes caught sight of me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Have you been researching until now?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>she asked.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Yeah, what about you?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I replied.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Yes.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Lucia nodded.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nShe glanced at the notes I was looking at and asked, \"What experiment did you conduct?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"It\\'s a secret.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"I\\'m curious, so I\\'ll tell you about my experiment if you tell me,\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Lucia said.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"No, I can\\'t tell you.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Especially not to you.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I couldn\\'t risk giving any hints to these geniuses.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Once they knew one thing, they could figure out ten more.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Senior, were you

reduce the amount of Matarahta and add a little more Todoranu sap and Pioner mushrooms.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Hmm, that makes sense.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But I\\'ve been feeling something since earlier...</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Lucia.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Why does it feel like I\\'m the only one doing the experiments while you just talk?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"It\\'s because of my mood, it\\'s because of my mood.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was hard to believe that Lucia, who was lying on the experimental desk eating snacks, was blaming it on her mood.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But ironically, her occasional advice did help me find the direction of the experiments.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Thirsty people dig wells.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It\\'s not Lucia, but me who needs money urgently.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Lucia, being the illegitimate daughter of a merchant noble family, was far from being short of money.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It seemed wasteful to immediately start experimenting without knowing about it, so I opened the herbalism textbook that Lucia had brought.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Todoranu, Todoranu...</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It\\'s here.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Unlike the item description in the game, it had a long explanation.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, most of it was unrelated to my current research, but there were definitely things to learn.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was a bit ridiculous that I didn\\'t know about this and just dove into it blindly...</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Senior, I\\'m bored.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I see.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Just wait a moment.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After reading the book, I started making the potion again based on the previous experiment results and Lucia\\'s advice.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The sensation of touching the ingredients with my hands was better than ever.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Oh, this one feels good, right?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Really?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I didn\\'t say anything, but for some reason, it felt good.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I just kept the doubts inside.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>When I made the 702nd potion...</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>-Ding!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>[You have created a Potion of Increased Stamina

<p>Her elegantly sculpted face was so beautiful that words couldn\\'t do it justice; it was even dazzling to the point of blinding one\\'s eyes.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Mmm.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nShe tossed and turned, causing her black hair to cascade over the edge of the bed like a waterfall.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Then, with a frown on her face, Dienne opened her eyes and sat up, supporting herself with her upper body.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nWith a stern expression on her face, she got up from the bed, rubbing her eyes.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Perhaps due to oversleeping after a long time, she vigorously washed her face to wake herself up.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Phew.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nKnock knock.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAs Dienne finished washing up and came out of the bathroom, she heard the sound of someone knocking on her door, accompanied by the voice of her friend, Yurihi.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Dienne!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Are you in there?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Yeah, just a moment.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nDienne tidied up her bed and opened the door.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Did you sleep well?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Yeah.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I stayed up late reading a book yesterday.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"You\\'ve been reading those magazines about knights again, haven\\'t you?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Even if you don\\'t have classes today, it\\'s not good for your skin if you keep doing that.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Yes, yes.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I know, Mom.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"I\\'ve never had a daughter like you.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nWith a half-serious, half-joking remark, they both smiled and headed out to the terrace attached to their dorm room, preparing a snack.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nSitting down, they leisurely enjoyed their tea while basking in the afternoon sunlight.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>They occasionally chatted about various gossip and discussed articles, which were Dienne\\'s main interest.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nBut when the conversation turned to the Knight Department, Yurihi\\'s expression turned bored.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"By the way, what\\'s with you coming right after class?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"You\\'re asking that now?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I almost forgot about it while we were talking.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Do you know about Lucia Everlast?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"I do.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"She succeeded in creating a new potion, and it\\'s currently being evaluated at the Rodren Matap.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Oh, really?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Dienne exclaimed in admiration.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nLucia Everlast was a giraffe known for her exceptional talent, even among the freshmen.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Despite rumors of her laziness, she had achieved something remarkable.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Dienne couldn\\'t help but be impressed.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"I heard she was lazy, but how much of a genius is she...\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Hey, what are you saying?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, it\\'s a bit unfair since you work hard too.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"No, not at all.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If a first-year student discovered a new potion, it\\'s really amazing.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I didn\\'t do anything when I was a first-year.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"You have a unique taste.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Why?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nWith a half-joking, half-serious tone, the two women chuckled and continued their conversation.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"But it is surprising.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I didn\\'t expect a first-year student to achieve such a feat.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Moreover, it\\'s not just an ordinary potion.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"What did she make?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Remember the stamina-boosting potion made from Mohaim?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>She improved it and increased the advantages while completely eliminating the side effects.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nDienne didn\\'t expect much when she asked, but upon hearing the content, she couldn\\'t help but be surprised.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Really?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Is that possible?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"I don\\'t know.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>We\\'ll have to wait until the evaluation is over.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Maybe the ingredients used are legendary herbs or something, so it\\'s meaningless.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Well, I doubt she would use something like that.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Still, isn\\'t Lucia Everlast backed by the famous Everlast family?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It\\'s reasonable to have some doubts, right?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nCertainly, there was a valid suspicion that she might have some backing, but Dienne shook her head.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"From what I\\'ve heard, Lucia is not that kind of person.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Would such a genius not have thought of that?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Well, you\\'re right.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Ah, and it\\'s not just Lucia Everlast who created this potion.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Collaboration?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Yes.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Don\\'t be too surprised when I tell you.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nWho could it be that she shouldn\\'t be too surprised about?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>With a grace that didn\\'t match her appearance, Yurihi melted Dienne\\'s heart with her cuteness.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Ahem, ahem.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Dienne unnie, I love you!\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Stop joking and tell me already.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I\\'m really curious.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nYurihi savored Dienne\\'s plea and then, with a mischievous smile, revealed the name that Dienne couldn\\'t believe even after hearing it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Andreas Cromwell.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"What did you say?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Ahem, pervert, shorty Andreas!\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Ugh...\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nDienne sighed and lowered her head.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Don\\'t joke around and tell me quickly.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Or was it just Lucia alone from the beginning?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"I\\'m not joking.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"What?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"I\\'m not joking.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The real Andreas is listed as a co-creator.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nAt the serious words of Yurie, Dienne\\'s face froze in place.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Adrias?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The Adrias who had less value than rolling trash?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>She couldn\\'t believe it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>No, she couldn\\'t accept it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"That\\'s ridiculous.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I thought the same.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Most people did.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But what can we do if it\\'s true?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The official announcement has already been made.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Check the tablet.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If an official announcement had been made, unless it was a huge mistake or an incredible error, it was true.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And Dienne knew that the possibility of such a mistake from her was very slim.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Still, she decided to check the magic tablet.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\'Lucia Everlast, Adrias Cromwell.\\'\\nTheir names were indeed listed together.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Wow.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Our Prince Adrias, who always groveled at our feet like he would lick the soles of our shoes, is capable of this!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Dienne-nim, how do you feel about this?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"......\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Without saying a word, Dienne suddenly stood up from her seat.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Dienne-nim?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>D-Dienne?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I have to go out.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Where to?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Lucia Everlast.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Dienne\\'s eyes, which had turned cold, deepened like an abyss.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I need to meet her and confirm.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Heh, heh!\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I tried my best to regulate my breathing.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I had to control my inhalation and exhalation in order to run longer.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But my body kept going off track, contrary to my will.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Phew.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Fortunately, I managed to complete the distance I aimed for before my breathing went awry.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I felt a terrible pain piercing through my lungs, but I stretched as if it was nothing.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I wanted to sit down and catch my breath immediately, but I endured the discomfort and suppressed it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The current time was 5 a.m.\\nIt was the time when dawn was breaking.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Lately, it had become my routine to exercise at this time every day.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After finishing my stretching, I headed straight to the physical training room.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Should I say it was funny or ironic?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The physical training room in the magic department had equipment and tools that were not inferior to those in the knight department.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It seemed that it had been prepared at the same level due to the complaints of the magic department students, who refused to be inferior to the knight department.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Well, honestly, what were those guys, who locked themselves in their rooms and conducted magic research, going to do with exercise?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Thanks to that, this place had become my personal gym.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Now, was it time to work on my lower body today?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Senior.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Hmm!\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I barely managed to hold back a scream and turned to confirm the presence of someone in the corner of the training room.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Lucia?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Heh.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Good morning.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Seeing her sleepy face and drowsy expression as she yawned, I couldn\\'t help but burst into laughter.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Why are you here?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"What are you doing here?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Senior, I\\'ve been waiting for you.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>While waiting, I took a nap.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"What are you talking about?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Senior, you don\\'t have a magic tablet, so there\\'s no way to contact you.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I heard that you exercise in the early morning, so I\\'ve been waiting since yesterday.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I couldn\\'t understand it at all.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Why did you wait like this just to tell me that?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Couldn\\'t you have just come and told me yesterday?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Senior, today is the day.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"What day?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"The day when the evaluation results come out and the interview.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>So, you have to go to the Matop with me.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"You\\'ve been waiting for this since yesterday?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>You could have just come and told me.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yesterday, I didn\\'t have time to come because I was held by some seniors.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Saying that, she was already preparing herself again, even with her eyes half closed.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Get up.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Just five more minutes...\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>She had even brought a sleeping bag and a pillow, and she fell back into sleep.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After observing her for a few days, I realized that she was a lazy person who had no interest in anything except for herbalism and potion making.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was astonishing how lazy she was.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>She didn\\'t even attend lectures except for herbology and potion making.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>What was even more surprising was that even though her attendance rate was a mess, she got a perfect score on the previous midterm exams, which showed how unfair this world was.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Since she was so eccentric and had a four-dimensional personality, it was difficult to deal with her at first, but now I was getting used to it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Leaving her asleep, I finished today\\'s workout and it was already 7 a.m.\\n\"Lucia, wake up.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Umm...</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Just a little more.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"We have to go to the Matop.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Until when?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Ugh.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>At the mention of Matop, Lucia, who had just opened her drowsy eyes, looked at me and said,\\n\"Seven...</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>thirty.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"What?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI asked again, thinking I heard wrong.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Seven o\\'clock?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Seven in the evening?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Seven thirty in the morning.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>What did you say?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Without thinking, I reflexively shook Lucia, who was lying down.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Huh?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I could feel Lucia being startled and flailing, but I grabbed her with an unknown force and started running.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"We\\'re late!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Run!\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Fortunately, Martop was located within the academy grounds, near the Department of Magic, so we were able to arrive on time.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, it was possible because Lucia got off and ran on her own during the trip.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Lucia Everlast, Adrias Cromwell, right?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Follow me.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Following the assistant belonging to Martop, we explored the complex interior of the tower.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>From the outside, it looked like a cylindrical building, but the interior was as complex as a maze.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Just when we thought we had walked a little, unexpected spaces appeared, and when we thought we were going up the stairs, we suddenly found ourselves going underground.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"My head is spinning.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If it weren\\'t for the assistant, I would have been lost without a clue, so I followed closely without relaxing my tension.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Senior, look at that.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>While following in such a daze, Lucia gestured somewhere.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>When I looked at where she was pointing, I saw a giant purple bird of prey sitting on a perch, scratching its beak.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Stormbringer!\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I\\'ve only heard about it, but it\\'s fascinating to see it in person.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It is a type of monster classified as a spirit.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As the name suggests, it is a monster that uses lightning and wind.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Since it is a spirit, its intelligence is very high, and if you become close to it, it can become a companion.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I myself had barely tamed it through countless saves and loads in the game.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Huh?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As we were admiring the Stormbringer, we suddenly became flustered.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Where did he go?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The assistant disappeared.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In a matter of less than five seconds, the assistant disappeared as if he had teleported.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Lucia and I looked at each other, puzzled by the sudden disappearance of the assistant.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"It\\'s better to stand still when you get lost.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Senior, even if we stand still here, the space keeps distorting.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"...Really?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>This was a setting I hadn\\'t seen in the game.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Back then, when the character entered Martop, they would be immediately teleported to their destination according to their purpose.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The process of walking like this was not depicted.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Oh, I suddenly remembered something.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"What is it?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Do you have a solution?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"No, not that.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It\\'s about what happened the day before yesterday.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I told you that I was caught by the seniors.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Why did she have to bring up that story now?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I wanted to take a peek into her mind and see what she was thinking and how she was living.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Senior, are you listening?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yeah.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>So?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Well, one of those seniors who caught me was Senior Dienne Alben.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Really?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It\\'s possible that Dienne could have come to find Lucia.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After all, playable characters who reside in the academy are bound to run into each other somehow.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As talented individuals, they would recognize other talented individuals.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But what could they have talked about?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I can\\'t know what happened since it was before the game started.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"But the reason she came to find you was because of me.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Me?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes, Senior.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Me?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Why?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>No, why did Dienne have to go find Lucia...</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Is it because of the potion?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>She asked why you were listed as a co-creator.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>She was very suspicious.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Hmm, I didn\\'t expect things to get tangled up like this.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I didn\\'t want to get involved with Dienne if possible.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"If you just told her the truth.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Hey!\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"No, you did well.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>No way!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I don\\'t want any more attention from playable characters.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If this continues, won\\'t I die in the game faster than in reality?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I wanted to scold Lucia for her handling of the situation, but I couldn\\'t vent my frustration on someone who didn\\'t know anything.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>She did consider me in her own way.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Senior, were you acquainted with Senior Dienne?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Uh, yeah.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Sort of.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Not the best relationship though.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Then.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It\\'s not a good relationship.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Suddenly, a voice interrupted us, and Lucia and I both turned our heads at the same time.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>A middle-aged man with both eyes covered by black fabric was sitting on the perch, leaning against it with one leg stretched out.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>On his arm, a Stormbringer was perched, acting cute.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And at the sight of him, I unintentionally shouted.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Bahart Alben...!\"</p>\\n  </body>\\n</html>\\n'\n",

that the owner of the Tower has appeared.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Tower Lord, are you going to judge us?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Hmm?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Judge?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n

<p>\"Crazy!\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I immediately deployed an Earth Shield, and Lucia used an unknown magic as well.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Crack!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Bang!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>My Earth Shield was shattered by a single lightning bolt, but I quickly deployed another one to protect us from the continuous barrage of lightning.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Senior, are you okay?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I also cast a Protect Shield for you.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Thank you.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I could finally breathe a sigh of relief at Lucia\\'s words.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>By the way, she\\'s already using a high-level magic like Protect Shield.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It doesn\\'t seem to take much time to cast, she\\'s truly a genius.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Compared to her, I\\'m just a beginner with my Earth Shield...</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If I die like this, it would be quite an achievement in its own way.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Achievement, my ass.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I thought to myself, but it\\'s stupid.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Fortunately, Bahat, who stopped laughing, immediately whistled, and Stormbringer regained its composure.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>He still had a lingering smile on his face as he spoke.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Hehe.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It seems your magical achievements are still intact.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I believe it will improve soon.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Hahat!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Even a passing dog would laugh at you.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Now you\\'re the one laughing at me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, I didn\\'t say it out loud, just thought it to myself.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Alright.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>You created a potion, huh?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I\\'m curious since you guys made it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Let\\'s go see it right away.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As Bahat waved his hand from the top of the tower, a magic circle appeared beneath our feet and instantly transported us to a different space.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Teleportation!\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Indeed, Bahat was a monster.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Magic related to space was second only to magic related to time in terms of difficulty.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Not just difficult, but if you have a basic understanding of space magic, you would be treated as a competent intermediate-level mage.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Handling the casting and arrangement of magic formulas and manifesting them in an instant was a completely different realm compared to spatial magic contained in artifacts or installation-type magic circles.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If you were able to use such magic at a level that disregarded the will and mana interference of others, then the word \"monster\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>suited you.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Bahat Tower Lord, how did we end up here?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"We coincidentally met on the way.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>You guys said you were going to have the evaluation of your potions today, right?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes, that\\'s correct.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In the room where the evaluation was taking place, three Tower-affiliated mages were waiting as judges.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>They didn\\'t know how to react to Bahat\\'s unexpected appearance.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Right.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Is this the potion?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The ingredient and efficacy tests are already done.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In fact, the safety of the potion has already been confirmed, and only the question and answer session about the students\\' production process and methods remained.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As the judge explained, Bahat dropped a drop of the potion into his mouth.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As he savored the taste for a moment, he quickly downed a whole bottle.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Mohaim fruit, leaves, toadstool sap, Jahas fruit, Pioner mushroom.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After saying that, he turned to Lucia.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"What are the other two?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Honpishi sap and Matara bark.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Honpishi and Matara.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>You put some thought into it.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>He chuckled and vanished, literally disappearing after finishing the potion bottle.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>He approached Lucia.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I\\'ve heard your story a couple of times.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But I didn\\'t expect you to pull such a bold move so soon.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Thank you.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Is that supposed to be a compliment?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Isn\\'t it?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Lucia asked calmly, raising her eyebrow.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Bahat, who had been standing with only the corners of his mouth raised, turned to the judges and said,\\n\"The inspection is over.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Stamp it for confirmation.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Confirmed, Topju-nim.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Phew, I was worried about what kind of backlash that crazy noble would give.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But it seems to have passed safely.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I remember cursing him countless times in the game as an unpredictable character.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>He had so many impulsive actions that he couldn\\'t even be a teammate.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>At that time, he was just a strong psychopath, but when he became real and faced me, his overwhelming presence exceeded my imagination.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Now, let\\'s talk about something else.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"......?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Why did Adrius come with you?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Lucia still had a puzzled expression, unable to understand his words.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Why would you lie and say that you made it alone when you probably did?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"What are you talking about?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Why would I say I made it alone?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Of course.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Isn\\'t that obvious?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Are you really saying that you actually made the potions with Adrius?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Hmm, I understand what you mean.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Just a moment!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>No, what were you two talking about...?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I hurriedly interrupted their conversation.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Somehow, that inspiration seemed to pass by normally.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Lucia\\'s reaction was also uneasy.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If she really said that she made it alone, I would be completely done for.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If something went wrong, my patent rights and the resulting profits would be gone.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"If it\\'s about the collaboration, it\\'s true.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Huh?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Lucia unexpectedly said something completely unexpected.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Even Senior Dianne came yesterday and asked the same thing, and her father showed the same reaction, so it\\'s interesting.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"What?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Dianne said it too?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I became interested when my daughter\\'s name came up.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Even if he\\'s crazy, he\\'s just a father in front of his daughter.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>She said she couldn\\'t believe it like you and asked various questions.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Then are you saying that what you said is true, that you really made it with Adrius?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"To be clear, if it\\'s about the collaboration, it\\'s true.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Then it\\'s okay to ask questions.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I came here for that anyway.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Good.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Then ask.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Bahat nodded and waved his hand again, and with the same magic circle as before, Lucia and I teleported.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Please speak a little before you write.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I\\'m going to faint from surprise.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I understand.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"What?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"This is a magic that can only be used inside the Matop.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>At Lucia\\'s sudden words, I just nodded.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Even in the midst of analyzing that?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Lucia had some peculiarities.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Bahat, who came with us, smiled at her words.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"What\\'s so great about figuring it out?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Hurry up and follow me.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>This time, we arrived at a huge laboratory.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>There were also wizards here, most of them sleeping on research desks or wandering around with dark circles under their eyes like zombies.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I shivered as if I saw my future self in those appearances.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Anyway, you can use the materials here, so try making that potion again.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Understood.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That\\'s a piece of cake.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I\\'ve become so familiar with these materials after touching them hundreds of times for several days.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In fact, Lucia, who had been just watching, had a higher chance of failing in the production.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I brought the materials for one batch from a separate warehouse set up in one corner of the laboratory and immediately started the production.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIt was difficult to handle the equipment in Matop\\'s laboratory compared to the ones I dealt with at the academy, but I quickly got used to it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>-Ding!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>[I have successfully created a Potion of Stamina Increase (Intermediate).]</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As soon as the extraction, fusion, and reaction processes were completed and the ingredients were properly mixed, a notification popped up.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I was able to produce the potion in just 5 minutes, and Bahart looked at me with an impressed expression.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But can he really see it even with his eyes covered?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Bahart tried the potion I made and drank it in one gulp, just like before.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Good.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Now, I have a question.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Please go ahead.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Why did you choose to use the essence of Honpishi?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I understand the general intention, but there were many other options, like Holman seeds or Popong surgery powder.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Because it is a liquid.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Even though it may seem insignificant, liquid mediums and solid mediums have different reactions in chemical reactions and extraction processes.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>We needed a liquid neutralizer as one of the essential ingredients, and it had to be able to fuse with the essence of Toadstool Tree without any side effects.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, even if the ingredients you mentioned were in liquid form, it would be impossible.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Why is that?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Because the essence of Honpishi is animal-based.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Those ingredients are plant-based, so it\\'s impossible.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Even if they perform a similar neutralizing function, they would result in completely different reactions during the fusion process.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>For example, if the mentioned ingredients were used instead, the traits of the weakly plant-based neutralizer, Pianer Mushroom, would be broken down.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And this doesn\\'t just end with decomposition, but it triggers a chain reaction that amplifies the hallucinogenic components of the Mohaim Fruit.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Everything I just said was not something I discovered myself, but hints from the game.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But in the end, it was all thanks to my efforts.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Perhaps no one who played this game put as much effort into finding combination methods as I did.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Have you tried it yourself?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I have tried both types of ingredients you mentioned.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, in the game.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It wasn\\'t a lie, so I confidently answered.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Bahart suddenly touched the cloth covering his eyes and then took it off.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Then he stared at me with excited eyes.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Are you really the Adrius Cromwell I know?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Who are you?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I am the Adrius Cromwell you mentioned.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"As I said, it\\'s important to assume that I know you.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Are you really the person I know?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I am.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Lord Alben.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Hehe.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>This is...</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>interesting.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>My heart skipped a beat at his sudden question.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I wondered if he had figured out that I was Kim Jin-hwan.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But thanks to my habit of hiding my emotions when I\\'m flustered, I was able to calmly answer.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"How long has it been since I last saw you?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Remember!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Think!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In a fleeting moment, Adrius\\' memories came to mind.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I think I saw you at the entrance ceremony.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It\\'s been about two and a half years.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Really?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I don\\'t know what happened during that time, but...\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I don\\'t know?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"It seems like it got quite interesting.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Thank you.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Although I said thank you, my mind was complicated.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I messed up.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Bahart Alben said it was interesting.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>There must have been something wrong for him to say that.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Are you interested in potion making?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Yes.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It\\'s not like I have a magical talent like you saw earlier, but...\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, I planned to upgrade my talent with my evolutionary trait.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Then let\\'s make a bet.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"A bet...\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I couldn\\'t refuse, so I trailed off at the end of my sentence.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Am I crazy?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Am I really making a bet with a lunatic like you?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"If you can create another new potion before the end of this year, it will be your victory.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But if you can\\'t, I will do whatever it takes to get you expelled.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>How about that?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The answer was already decided.</p>\\n  </body>\\n</html>\\n'\n",

 <p>\\nWhen someone gets angry, they tend to become colder.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That\\'s exactly what happened this time.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Last time, I even threw a flask while screaming.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, it worked out well for me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I bowed my head to Professor Silk and left his office.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nBefore I could even settle down, Adrias was not just idling around.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>He occasionally ran errands for the professors and earned some pocket money.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And just now, he got into trouble.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But if it were me, I would have done the same.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Not only did I not do what was asked of me, but I also didn\\'t even mention that I

to pay attention, I walked to the library to return the borrowed book.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But even on my way to the library, I could feel strange glances from the people around me.</p>\\n

<br/>\\n    <p>First, because my true identity almost got exposed, and second, because I realized that I am currently in an unknown time period and have no idea what will happen.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"That building wasn\\'t there before.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nOn my way back from Matop with Lucia, I happened to see the academy building.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was a building that didn\\'t exist in the game.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>According to my knowledge, there was a graveyard instead of a building in that location.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"I barely remembered it yesterday.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIn the game, it wasn\\'t an important event, so I had forgotten about it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Well, it wasn\\'t something I could change anyway.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"But one thing is for sure.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It hasn\\'t happened yet, but it will happen soon.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nOf all times, I happened to come here at a strange time.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Approximately six months until the game starts.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It meant that a terror attack would occur within six months.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of

know how many would die, but the fact that a named character was involved was troublesome.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Moreover, that character was closely related to playable characters.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Carlos Alben.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThe eldest son of Duke Alben and the older brother of Dienne Alben.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In the game, he was already in a future time period after his death, so I have never seen him in person.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>However, he was mentioned occasionally due to his important connection with Dienne Alben and Bahat Alben.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Ah!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Adrias Cromwell, a student.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Hello.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAs I was lost in thought, when I arrived at the library, the librarian greeted me cheerfully.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"I came to return a book.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"It\\'s been exactly a week since you borrowed \\'The

did you say a week?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Oh, by the way, Adrias, there\\'s a rumor going around that you developed a new potion...\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"I\\'m sorry.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I have something urgent to take care of.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI hastily left the library.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That idiot.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Did my intelligence also follow his body when I entered Adrias\\'s body?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>How could I forget about that?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Running without thinking, I soon slowed down.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"But what can I do?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nWhen I calmed down a bit, I realized there was nothing I could do.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That\\'s right.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Today is the day Angela evolves, but I had no way to enter the research lab.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Then...</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I need to come up with an excuse.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I first visited the magic ingredient shop within the academy.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"It\\'s the first time you\\'ve come to

of the laboratory, didn\\'t I?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I\\'m sorry.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I was just too happy to see you.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Hmm....\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Karon was in the magic circle research laboratory in the academy for personal business.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I asked around and barely found the location before finding him and he brought me to his office, saying that he had just finished his work.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Karon, who had been giving me a strange look, soon clicked his tongue.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Sit down.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"So, what brings you here?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Professor, I actually developed a potion.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I thought it would be proper to inform you at least once, so I came to find you.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"You came early.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Did you think you wouldn\\'t be robbed now that the evaluation is over?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>He throws a direct question.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Yeah!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I did it secretly because I thought you might take it away!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>How about that?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"...Ha, haha.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I just wanted to show confidence after passing the evaluation...\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, I wasn\\'t crazy enough to say what I really thought.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Whether Karon knew my true intentions or not, he continued to look at me with penetrating eyes before finally getting up from his seat.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Follow me.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As planned, I was able to enter the research laboratory.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Karon opened the laboratory with the interaction of mana and the light of the ring.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Just as I was about to follow him, I couldn\\'t help but stop at his back, which suddenly stopped.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Master?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"....\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The atmosphere was not good.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>When I briefly tilted my body to see inside, which was hidden from Karon, I could see that it was a mess.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Damn, am I too late?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That aside, how did he break free from the mana restraints?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Did he become strong enough to break free from the restraints through evolution?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Wait a minute.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Is he still inside?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I shivered all over and unconsciously took a step back.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>He\\'s a powerful being, even for a vampire.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Let alone if he has evolved.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But the success rate was 55%, right?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, it\\'s hard to say that it failed when I see that mess.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Still, as I calculated the possibility of something unexpected, Karon stepped forward and entered first.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As he entered, I hesitated, thinking that I could run away at any moment, and followed him slowly.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"How dare you....\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Karon\\'s cold voice trembled with anger.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>There was no intact place in the interior of the laboratory, as if someone had gone on a rampage.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Various instruments and reagents were broken and discarded, and the collected corpses were torn to pieces.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As the existence that caused this havoc came to mind, I seriously considered whether I should run away now.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Adrias.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes, Master.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"When was the last time you came?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Well....\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I couldn\\'t come up with an answer immediately as I was already contemplating how to escape.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"It was six days ago when I went to the vacant Hartz National Cemetery.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I managed to recall the answer, but Karon didn\\'t react and continued to look around.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And after looking around for a while, he asked another question.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Have you visited yesterday or today?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"What?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>No, I haven\\'t.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, there\\'s no way I would have.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>You had the key in the first place.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Having heard my answer, Karon finally walked towards the broken window where Angela was.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I watched from a distance, tensed up, wondering if Karon would spit blood and die.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"This mixed-blood...\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>A muffled anger came out of his mouth.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Adrias.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Have you ever touched Angela\\'s restraints?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"No, I haven\\'t.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Did you think I was crazy enough to touch it?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>What if it gets released?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>...Although in the end, it was released because of me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Well, if it weren\\'t for you going crazy, why would you do such a thing?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"No, there isn\\'t.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"If I had touched her in the first place, she would have already been dead.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Shut your mouth.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>He seems uncomfortable.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Well, it\\'s understandable.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The top-grade materials that were supposed to be used after raising the level of the command technique had escaped.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If I couldn\\'t even try using nickel and thought it was stolen or disappeared somewhere, I would have been furious.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The only difference between him and me is that I believed in my evolutionary trait and used it right away, while he just saved it as much as possible and ended up with nothing.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Crash!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Karon picked up a flask bottle nearby and threw it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If calm Karon is like this, it seems like his anger has reached its limit.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"...Get out.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Fortunately, he didn\\'t vent his anger on me and just chased me away.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Judging from the situation, it seemed that Angela had already escaped and was no longer here.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I\\'m not sure about the exact time, but it\\'s definitely been a week since today, so she probably escaped not too long ago.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Leaving Karon alone, I quietly left the office.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The empty office felt dusty.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Adrias.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"......!\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I was so surprised that my body stiffened.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Someone was whispering in my ear, right next to me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>When did she...?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"What did you do to me?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Her seductive voice tickled my neck.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I thought she had just escaped, but I was too defenseless.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But still, I didn\\'t expect her to be hiding in the office.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Adrias, look at me.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But did she always speak like this?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I felt more familiarity than hostility in her voice.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Since I was in a position where my life was at stake, I listened carefully.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Ha.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I covered my mouth that almost let out a gasp.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Angela, with her red hair flowing all the way to the floor, was not the same as the Angela I knew before.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Her seductive eyes, tear dots, and the strange color flowing between them showed her presence.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Her thick, red lips, as if soaked in blood, made the atmosphere even more intense.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And the shabby and tattered clothes she was wearing made her appearance even more eerie.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Of course, I will face her with confidence.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I don\\'t have any personal feelings.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>She wanted me to see, right?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Angela Lucifel.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Keep your promise.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I took the initiative and confronted her gaze.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Promise?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Shouldn\\'t you explain the situation first?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I couldn\\'t release the mana restraint on my own.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>So I used a different method.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was a lie, but I tried to make it sound plausible.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"What method?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I don\\'t have to answer that.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Isn\\'t it enough to just get you out somehow?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Hmph!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>You\\'re saying it as if you got me out.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I got out myself.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Even if I didn\\'t have the power, would that have been possible?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In the end, what\\'s important is that you got out.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If it wasn\\'t me, you would have become an undead to Karon.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As I struggled to survive, the words came out naturally.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>She is a being who can eliminate me with a single gesture.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If I\\'m going to die anyway, I might as well do something.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Karon?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>You\\'re calling your master?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Is that important now?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Anyway, keep your promise.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"No, I won\\'t.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Keeping all the promises doesn\\'t suit me.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>What\\'s with this talk about keeping all the promises!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I wanted to shout, but I barely held back.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Then what are you going to do?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I\\'ll keep half of the promises.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"...Only half?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I took a step back.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Exactly.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Just half of the promises I made.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Before she finished speaking, I tried to turn around and run away, but she was suddenly standing in front of me as if teleporting.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>With sharp fangs exposed, Angela approached me with a seductive smile, blocking my way.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I\\'ll see if you can keep your promise.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>With that, I was trapped.</p>\\n  </body>\\n</html>\\n'\n",

hot?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Lucia asked, looking at me with a gaze that made me feel like a pervert.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nNot only her, but all the students in the classroom turned to look at me at least once.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"I\\'m just not feeling well.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Then why did you come out instead of resting?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"I have to

  <p>\\n\\nI had no choice but to wear a scarf because of what happened the previous day.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It would be suspicious if I only wore a scarf, so I ended up wearing winter clothes and felt like I was going to freeze to death.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"When will this end?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThe reason I\\'m like this is because of the scar on my neck.</p>\\n

have to endure it as a weak person.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThe day before, Angela bit my neck, promising that she would see me again after keeping only one promise.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The promise she kept was to save my life.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The promise she didn\\'t keep was to kill Caron.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Even without the promise, she would have had enough reason to hold a grudge against Caron and just leave.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But it\\'s just a doubt.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI was just grateful that I survived.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Cough,

know.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThat\\'s why you did it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nEven though I asked, you made fun of me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"I clearly remember asking for advice at that time.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"What did you say?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"I understand that you asked for advice during the previous class.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The ingredients

  <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, I conducted the lecture without disturbing other students.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Are you saying that I should have come to you separately after class?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"......You\\'re being quite aggressive.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAh, I don\\'t know.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nJust let it out!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI\\'m an 8-ton truck with a broken handle!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nKim Jin-hwan, who merged with Adrias, cannot bear it!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"I don\\'t understand why I had to come to you separately for advice.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Well, is it a way of saying that I should be good at socializing?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It\\'s confusing for me when you make fun of a student who asked a question during class and then casually say something like that.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI yelled.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThe professor\\'s face, which had turned crimson, trembled.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nWell, what can you do?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n...Are you going to deduct my grade?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That\\'s a bit of a problem...</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Th-th-this...!\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Professor.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nJust when Professor Beoban was about to explode, Lucia intervened at an appropriate time.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nProfessor Beoban tried to give Lucia a look of disdain, but soon recognized her and calmed down.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Let me speak, can I?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I went to ask my fellow students about the ingredients mentioned in the previous class.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Thanks to that, I was able to contribute as a co-creator of the potion this time.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\nLucia\\'s sudden outburst caught Vervan off guard, but he managed to suppress his anger and nodded with a calm expression.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"If I had sought advice from Professor, I could have made it faster.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But I think it\\'s meaningful to research and question things on my own without anyone\\'s help.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That\\'s what our mages are supposed to do, right?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Y-yes, you\\'re right,\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Vervan replied, raising his voice slightly.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Unlike before, he didn\\'t even make a squeak.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThere seemed to be something between them.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>What was it?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Lucia couldn\\'t think of anything, even when she thought about the game version of herself.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The only thing she could deduce was that it might have something to do with Lucia\\'s family, Everlast.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nStill, thanks to Lucia taking the lead, the situation had turned around.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"I\\'ll seek advice from Professor and try new concoctions next time.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I believe that Professor will also passionately develop new potions with us in the future.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Ahem!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Yes, of course.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nVervan coughed awkwardly and turned his gaze away.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Seeing him wanting to stop talking, Lucia turned her head towards me and smiled.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nYeah, thanks.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Inma.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nWith just the shape of my mouth, I expressed my gratitude and left the room.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Lucia playfully smiled at me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nLucia watched Adrian\\'s retreating figure as he left the room.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"He\\'s changed.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nShe didn\\'t know when it started.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>She wasn\\'t interested in Adrian either.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Her first impression of him was gloomy and unapproachable.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>His expression, which seemed to be thinking about something with a gloomy and foolish look, was made even darker by his messy hair covering his face.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nContrary to his gloomy and introverted appearance, he was actively clinging to her at first.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>He even invited her to an expensive restaurant, which was quite annoying.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Adrian\\'s expression at that time.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That incident might have been the trigger.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAdrian started avoiding her when she didn\\'t have any interest in him in the first place.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was probably because of that.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After that, they never had a chance to face each other naturally.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThen, one day, it happened.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Do you happen to know if any ingredients like the essence of Hwonsi or the bark of Martarata can be used?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nOut of the blue?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThat thought and a vague feeling that it could be something important touched her senses.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Since she was young, she had researched various medicinal herbs and even monster byproducts to cure her congenital disease.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The ingredients Adrian mentioned had enough potential and were worth testing.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAdrian, who had a conversation with her about it, was strangely different.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>She couldn\\'t pinpoint it, but something had changed compared to before.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, that was it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>She didn\\'t expect much when she threw out the words because she herself wasn\\'t sure about the ingredients.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nBut his expressions and conversations after that were enough to make her wonder if this person was the same Adrian she knew.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That\\'s why she unintentionally suggested working together, and he eventually agreed.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Unlike before, there was no hesitation or discomfort when facing her.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Why is he so calm?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Is he just enduring it?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIn fact, she knew that her personality was peculiar.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>4th dimensional?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Sociopath?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Self-centered thinking?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Laziness?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>All seemed to fit.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was just a matter of degree.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>There was no need to attach reasons to why things turned out this way, but it seemed that the influence of her terminal illness played a big role.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nExternally, she seemed fine, but her body was like a ticking time bomb, just like a terminal patient.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The despair of knowing that she would die no matter what she did had shaped the person she was now.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Well, Jahas, then.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Handle it so that the main roots are not damaged....\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The professor who was giving a lecture in front of me couldn\\'t even cure the disease.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Even though he received so much money.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That\\'s why she studied and researched on her own.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, the more she studied and researched, the more despair and frustration increased.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Because of this environment, she had no friends by her side.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>At first, people tried to befriend her because of her background and appearance, but eventually they all drifted away.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Maybe that\\'s why.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Even though it was only a week, it was fascinating that Adrias, who accepted all of her peculiar behavior, was there.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Recently, he even started exercising, so he was quite unique for a magician.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"A magician doing exercise.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And it\\'s that gloomy seaweed Adrias.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>By now, she thought she could drop the gloomy part.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Then it\\'s Seaweed Adrias?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Seaweed....\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Pfft.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>When she burst into laughter, the students who were listening to the lecture turned to look at her.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But after confirming the face of the person who laughed, they just ignored her.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"If she was a senior, she would have said something.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Why is that?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Even though they just broke up, Lucia missed Adrias\\' nagging.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I finally have some free time.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>My lecture schedule was unexpectedly tight, so I didn\\'t have a day off except for weekends.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I was busy with potion research even on weekends.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Even without potion research, most of my weekends were spent running errands for Caron.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Now, what should I do during this time to make a good impression?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>First, there were three options to choose from.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Potion making, exercise, and magic training.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, all three had to be done consistently, but what I needed to decide now was the detailed plan.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>To be honest, potion making was not something I would pay much attention to if it weren\\'t for the bet with Bahat.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Even if I think about the bet, there was still about four months left this year, so the burden wasn\\'t that big.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Moreover, Bahat gave me a card and told me to research freely without worrying about the cost of materials only for this year.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Besides, I have talent in potion making.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, it was still at the beginner level and didn\\'t help much.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But....</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>[Adrias Cromwell: Evolution possibility of potion making buff skills 41%]</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The evolution possibility has increased by 9% since then.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was information I found out a few days ago, and the evolution possibility was similar to proficiency.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The more experience I gained, the higher the possibility became.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Can I try again if the evolution fails?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>This was still a question, but just in case, I raised the possibility to a safe level and decided to evolve.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And unlike that, there was no indication that other talents could evolve.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It seemed that I had to accumulate proficiency like in potion making....</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"The problem is that I can\\'t use dark magic freely.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Currently, it was the biggest problem for me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Unless I had a hidden personal research lab like Caron, it was impossible to train in dark magic.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Just a moment, can\\'t the proficiency increase just by summoning it?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Suddenly, a crazy thought came to my mind that if I roughly dressed Nickel and just hid his appearance, it would be okay.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If I only summoned him inside the room, there was no reason to be discovered, and in case, no, in a million to one chance, if someone witnessed it, I just had to make sure they didn\\'t notice that he was a skeleton right away.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Therefore, I immediately summoned Nickel.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>[Summon one Skeleton Soldier]</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Nickel immediately popped out of the dimensional space.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I wonder what\\'s inside there?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Long time no see, Nickel.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Let\\'s start with putting on clothes.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I dressed Nickel in the thick winter clothes I had worn before.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Then, at first glance, he looked like an ordinary person.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Now, does the proficiency increase?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>When I raised my summoner character, just summoning it increased not only the proficiency but also the skill level.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I had to check if Necromancer was the same.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>-Dark Magic: Basic Command (20/100)</p>\\n    <br/>\\n

<br/>\\n    <p>He was in a strange posture, swinging his arms up and down as if he was disturbed by something.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"What are you doing?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>When I asked, he looked at me as if he was bothered, and then he wrote something in the air.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Training?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Wow, this guy.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Even though he\\'s my skull, his concept is clear.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>He must have been swinging his sword and died, or something like that.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>...Wait a minute?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>A sudden thought struck me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Nickel, can you teach me swordsmanship?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p/>\\n  </body>\\n</html>\\n'\n",

middle of the room, holding a suitable length of branch that I had found outside.</h1>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The Empire Academy\\'s student dormitory, which was provided free of charge, assigned spacious rooms to each individual, so it didn\\'t hinder my training.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Speaking of the dormitory, while there were dormitories provided for free, there were also dormitories that required payment.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Most of these paid dormitories were occupied by noble families or children of influential figures.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I heard that the quality of the rooms in those dormitories wasn\\'t much different from here, but it felt like they were staying there to show off their wealth and status.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"If Adrias had money, he would have tried to move into one of those places,\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I thought to myself.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThere\\'s a saying that goes, \"Birds of a feather flock together.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It\\'s only natural for friendships to form and gatherings to take place among students living in the same dormitory.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The connections I made through such interactions turned out to be quite useful even after graduating from the academy.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, graduates who have graduated from the Rodren Academy are welcomed anywhere simply because of that fact.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>However, it cannot be denied that the efficiency of forming connections is overwhelming in paid dormitories.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"What\\'s the point of making connections?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I should be worrying about graduating first,\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I muttered to myself, and Nickel looked at me with a strange gaze.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Was it an overreaction?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Nickel, who didn\\'t even have eyes, shouldn\\'t be looking at me like that.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Focus!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nNickel forcefully wrote something with his finger.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Yes, teacher,\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I replied.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI wasn\\'t sure how much self-awareness Nickel had, but he seemed to have a rather unique personality.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Who would start training in swordsmanship as soon as they were resurrected as a skeleton?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Nickel either knew or didn\\'t know about my thoughts.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI held the branch I had brought and assumed a stance.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Since I had asked him to teach me from the basics, I learned how to hold and position the sword first.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Like this?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I imitated the basic stance as best as I could, and Nickel lightly tapped my body with the branch.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Surprisingly, it had some force behind it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Is this a skeleton?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Why is it so strong?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I wondered.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nFrom then on, I learned the basics under Nickel\\'s guidance.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was the guidance of a level 6 master.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Perhaps not many people in this world could enjoy such luxury.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>No, maybe I was the only one.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Those arrogant guys are too busy with their own nonsense to raise disciples,\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I speculated.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, it was just a guess.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>At least the guys I met in the game were all abnormal.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It wasn\\'t limited to Oro Master; most of the named characters who seemed somewhat powerful were like that.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Just look at Bahat, whom I met last time.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The fact that his inspiration covered his eyes was all part of the concept.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Maybe the next time I meet him, he\\'ll be doing something else with a strange disguise or behavior.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Ugh, why am I talking to myself?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Strength was everything.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As long as I was strong, I could do whatever I wanted.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Thwack!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Ah!\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Nickel\\'s branch hit my forehead.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But it hurt more than I had imagined.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Focus!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I immediately held the branch and started writing.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nLooking around this world, mana doesn\\'t simply increase by being idle.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, as you grow older and your body develops, mana naturally increases.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But the moment growth stops and aging begins, mana decreases.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The only way to increase mana was through consistent mana usage.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Just like muscles in the body, using and recovering mana gradually increased its quantity.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>However, consuming mana without any purpose was inefficient.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It did increase, but the growth was slow.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That\\'s why, regardless of being a mage or a swordsman, training alongside actual combat was necessary.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Huff, huff.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>A foul odor emanated from my mouth.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Sweat poured out like rain, and my arms were already trembling at their limits.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But I never lowered my arms or let go of the branch.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThat\\'s enough.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Nickel drew something in the air.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"I can still go on,\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I said determinedly.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I tried to force myself to come here for no reason, but my arms quickly gave out and fell down.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Immense pain spread from both shoulders to my back muscles.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Did I push myself too hard?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But there was a good reason to push myself.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Unlike magicians who can manipulate mana with innate talent, swordsmen awaken their mana usage through relentless physical training.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Although those with talent close to zero cannot awaken their mana even with training, this method generally works for about five out of ten people.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That\\'s why most nobles start knight training if they don\\'t have talent as a magician.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"In other words, if a magician\\'s talent is 90%, a swordsman\\'s talent is only about 60%.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Although talent is a very important factor, it is not comparable to magic, so it was worth a try.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>On the contrary, there were many weak people who had talent but didn\\'t put in the effort.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That\\'s how important effort was for swordsmen.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Effort?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I exercised like eating when I was Kim Jin-hwan.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I might have exercised more than eating.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I had some confidence in my physical abilities.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>While having useless thoughts, I decided to try raising my skill level now that my training was over.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>- Dark Magic: Basic Command (22/100)</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\xe3\\x80\\x89\\xe3\\x80\\x89 Skeleton Summoning LV3 \"Oh.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It went up by a whopping 2 in just five hours.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It\\'s so sweet because the skill level goes up without consuming mana.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It\\'s said that if you summon for about 200 hours, it becomes a beginner command.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Of course, once it becomes a beginner, the skill level will increase much slower.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And it\\'s meaningless if you don\\'t learn beginner magic.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I admired my increased skill level and took a rest when Nickel approached and tapped my shoulder.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It felt like the touch of a grandfather who said I did well.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And then he immediately started swinging his stick again.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was really my own skull, but it jingled.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In a way, it could be seen as an advantage as a skull.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Skulls don\\'t get tired.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"You might have been better off becoming a skull.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>You\\'re so lucky to be able to train endlessly, aren\\'t you?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>While I was absentmindedly watching Nickel\\'s movements, I suddenly had this thought.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If I continue training without instructions, my skills will improve quickly under Nickel\\'s guidance.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>How do I avoid getting tired?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In the game, I used potions as a trick.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I ate potions and trained every time my stamina dropped.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Can\\'t I do that too?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Luckily, I have Bahat\\'s card.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was an unlimited use license for potion ingredients.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, simply using health potions was not meaningful.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>What I needed now was...</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Recovery and Regeneration potions.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Recovery potions and Regeneration potions are different.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Recovery restores to the original state and is mainly used for healing internal injuries or recovering from fatigue rather than external trauma.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In the case of external trauma or visible wounds, Regeneration potions were used, which literally increased the regeneration speed.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In the game, I used health potions and recovery potions as tricks, but this is reality.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"With Regeneration potions, I can shorten the time it takes for muscles to be destroyed and regenerated, and recover from fatigue with health potions and recovery potions.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In theory, with potions alone, infinite training was possible with perseverance and effort.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, drinking a Regeneration potion wouldn\\'t immediately heal torn muscles, but at least the training cycle would be much faster.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That wasn\\'t the point here.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I have to make them right away.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>This year is the only chance to suck up honey.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I have Bahat\\'s card, so I should use it as much as possible!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It\\'s time to make new potions.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>On the continent of Luderion, there were numerous countries and powers.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Among them, the Empire, Rodren, exerted immense influence at the center of the continent.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It would not be an exaggeration to say that there was no place where their influence did not reach except beyond the northern mountains.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As such, the capital of the empire, which led the trend and was most sensitive to information, was busy with its daily routine.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Gaju, I have updated the list of incoming freshmen and the reports of current students scheduled to enter next year.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>At the butler\\'s words, Marquis Cloche nodded as he checked the tablet.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Good.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Thank you for your hard work.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The middle-aged man with intense red hair that reminded one of a lion\\'s mane was the head of a family that competed for power even within the mighty empire and was himself a formidable master.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>He had come to the capital for a brief visit.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The Duke of Cloche, who visited the mansion, skimmed through the tablet.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"These guys are promising.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The students of Rodren Academy were talented individuals who were closely watched even in countries around the world.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Although the interest was limited to the graduates, there were some new students who had remarkable backgrounds among those who would enter next year, so an interested smile hung on the Duke of Cloche\\'s lips.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I didn\\'t expect to have someone recommended by Deshern himself.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"According to the intelligence report, it was already partly anticipated.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"There\\'s a world of difference between anticipation and what actually happens.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Do you know what I mean?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes, Your Highness.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Well, anyway, it\\'s not surprising considering he\\'s the one who broke the records of all the top students in Monas Academy.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Noble children and talented commoners recognized by the empire could apply to Monas Academy when they were around 8 or 9 years old.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Monas Academy was a sub-concept of Rodren Academy, and the top 50% of Monas Academy automatically gained admission to Rodren Academy.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The exception was the high-ranking noble children of the empire, who could enter Rodren Academy regardless of their grades or talents.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Since they couldn\\'t graduate if they didn\\'t have talent, admission itself didn\\'t hold much significance.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"There were also some students who caught my eye.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yeah.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I should start checking on the others too.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>They\\'re the ones who will be entering Rodren now.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As the Duke of Cloche flipped through the tablet, he soon stopped at a certain point.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"This.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>They say a new potion has been invented?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I have prepared it here in advance.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Bring it to me.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>A potion that had not yet been officially registered but had come into the hands of the Duke of Cloche through his influence.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>He looked closely at the yellow potion and said,\\n\"Lucia Everlast?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>She is an upper-class single-minded girl with Everlast\\'s top-down supremacy.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It\\'s not accurate, but according to the information we secretly obtained, she seems to have a congenital incurable disease.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"That\\'s unfortunate.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>To create something that even most magicians couldn\\'t do at such a young age.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After licking his tongue a few times, he swallowed the potion.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>While savoring the taste for a moment, he looked at his own hand, clenched it, and then released it repeatedly.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"It\\'s on a different level.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Have you tried it?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I haven\\'t experienced it yet.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"This is truly amazing.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The comparison with existing potions is impossible.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And there are no side effects, they say?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"For now, that\\'s correct.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"If it is officially registered and commercialized, it will create quite a sensation.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I didn\\'t know it would be to that extent.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Should I raise its priority level?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>To feel the abilities of the potion, the Duke of Cloche moved his body.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As someone who had experience in manipulating the body, he could quickly feel the changes in his body.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\'Maybe this is more suitable for people who are not like me, but rather those who lack stamina.\\'\\nAs he reached that thought, the Duke of Cloche suddenly remembered his subordinate, McKein, who hadn\\'t seen his child for over 50 years.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As a token of his gratitude for his hard work, he came up with a brilliant idea to give him this potion.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Your Highness, there is one more peculiar thing related to the potion.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Hmm?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>What is it?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"It is stated in the report, but there is a co-creator.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>At the butler\\'s words, the Duke checked the tablet again.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Adrias Cromwell?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Ah, he\\'s Cain Cromwell\\'s son.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>He briefly recalled the Cromwell Viscount family.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If his memory was correct, the Cromwell Viscount family was a family in crisis that was in danger of being demoted at the upcoming nobility conference at the end of this year.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"There is almost no report on that guy.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Did he have talent in this field from the beginning?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"According to the investigation, despite being a third-year student this year, he is only now taking intermediate herbology.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>He has a record of completing basic potion-making last year.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"So, you\\'re saying he didn\\'t have talent?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"That\\'s how the intelligence department sees it.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I see.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Still, take this opportunity to look into him a little more.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>This potion is worth that.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes, Your Highness.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The butler immediately changed the importance level written in Adrias Cromwell\\'s report.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\'Adrias Cromwell, importance level changed from none

<p>*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThere was a significant event prepared at the Academy in October.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIt was none other than the mid-term evaluation at the end of the month.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIt felt similar to the mid-term exams in my previous world, but it wasn\\'t simply solving problems on paper.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The content of the evaluation varied every year and every time, so I didn\\'t know what to expect.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI just hoped that it would be an assignment that I could handle.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Alright, let\\'s finish today\\'s class here.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And now, let\\'s talk a little about the content of the mid-term evaluation that will take place at the end of the month.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThe mandatory advanced combat magic class for third-year students, Intermediate Battle Magic, was a detailed lecture that taught everything from the analysis and description of offensive magic to the basic mindset and actions in combat.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThe professor\\'s name was Tolman Venuel.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>He was a retired battle mage who had worked in the Northern Mountain Range border for over 10 years.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI heard that dozens of soldiers left that place every day, so working there for over 10 years was truly remarkable.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Even though I had been in a special forces unit for over 10 years myself, I didn\\'t perform missions every day, so I could truly appreciate his greatness.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nHe was also a highly influential figure who provided numerous help and teachings to playable characters, so I tried to pay attention to him as much as possible.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"While I\\'m not sure if the evaluations for other classes have been announced, in Intermediate Battle Magic, we have decided to go on a field trip to the Knight Department during this mid-term evaluation period.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"The Knight Department?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"A field trip?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>What does that mean?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Just watching?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThe students were taken aback by the unexpected topic.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And in the story of the Knight Department, I could see a person whose eyes were sparkling.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Knight Department!\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>She was none other than Dienne Alven.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>She is a huge fan of knights despite being a magician.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Since it was just a setting in the game, I didn\\'t pay much attention to it when I played the game.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, thanks to that setting, she also becomes the heroine of the first playable character.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>By the way, the first playable character was a freshman in the Knight Department who will enter next year.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I should consider myself lucky.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I was worried whether it was fortunate that such an event happened before entering school.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Three of the freshmen who will enter next year are playable characters.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And all three of them are characters who belong to the Knight Department and will kill Adrias.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"That\\'s all the information.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I\\'ll explain in detail on the day of the evaluation.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Professor Tolman left the classroom with those words.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Then the students started speculating about the evaluation.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Could it be a duel with the Knight Department student?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Hey, even if that\\'s the case, how can we beat a knight one-on-one?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I mean, they won\\'t be in the same grade, they\\'ll probably fight against the lower grades.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"That hurts our pride!\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Well, what do you think then?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Huh?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Yeah, that\\'s right.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>What can we do in the Knight Department?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I was curious too.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Since I am aiming for graduation, I wanted to get good grades, but if the evaluation is a duel like that, I was confident that I would lose without even being able to use my hands.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Since I had played as Dienne, who is the same grade as me, in the evaluations and exams that will be held next year, I was familiar with them, but this year I had no choice but to leave it to luck.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Maybe I\\'ll have to just endure until this year is over.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>With the evolution I brought, there was plenty of potential for growth.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But my current skills were far behind, so I couldn\\'t show a good performance in the upcoming evaluations.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Well, let\\'s take it one step at a time.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Soon, it will be time for the talent of potion brewing to evolve.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, it\\'s not 100%, but if it\\'s 89%, it should be enough for evolution.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>With this, I had to make potions, increase my swordsmanship, and make use of the dual core ability.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As for magic, I have been studying basic books from time to time, so I believed that I would gradually improve through evolution, and my knowledge of tactics was enough for now since I had Nickel.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The plan was quite ideal.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"The problem is whether I can endure without revealing my true identity.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If only that damn Caron doesn\\'t find out, it should be fine.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Come to think of it, it wasn\\'t just Caron who was the problem.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>There were other villains in this academy besides Caron.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>There were other black magicians who were probably related to Caron, followers of the Jepar sect, and one crazy woman hiding.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It wasn\\'t a concern for now with the followers of the Jepar sect and the crazy woman, but I was worried that I might run into other black magicians.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"That black magician also has a student like me as a subordinate.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Were there three of them?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>By the way, it was a fatal flaw for him to have three students as subordinates.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Because of the students he had as subordinates, he was chased after not long after the game started.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After that, he was exposed before Adrias and suffered a joint attack from the people around him.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The story was about a player who hadn\\'t grown as much as Adrias fighting with the help of the people around him but eventually losing him.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Leaving the classroom and thinking, I found myself in the research lab, which had become more familiar than the dormitory.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I immediately signed the visitor log and rental log and headed to the research lab located at the innermost part of the research building.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>[Evolution in progress....]</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>[Time remaining: 3 minutes 43 seconds]</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It\\'s really perfect timing.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I tried to calm my excitement as I watched the time tick away, which was about to reveal the results.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>[Time remaining: 00 seconds]</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>[Adrias Cromwell: Potion brewing buff series is evolving...]</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Finally.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I have finally stepped out of mediocrity.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Even though potion-making may not be a great help in magic itself, I feel a sense of potential.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If this worked, it means that I can surpass being just a general talent and become a genius in any other talent as well.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"To celebrate becoming a water talent, I will definitely succeed today.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Coincidentally, after the evolution was complete, the feeling of being sick also disappeared.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>My condition was at its best, so I felt like something good was going to happen today.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I immediately took out the materials I had prepared and started experimenting.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I have created a regeneration potion (inferior).\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I have created a recovery potion (inferior).\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The growth of my talent was astonishing.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Honestly, I didn\\'t expect much from my talent since it wasn\\'t something visible, but it far exceeded my expectations.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Honestly, I didn\\'t even imagine that I would be able to make them right away...\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The talent was a sensation that couldn\\'t be expressed in words.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Although it was just a talent that evolved from a general talent to a water talent, when I held the materials in my hands and started experimenting, my mind displayed calculations and senses like a computer running.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"If I\\'m capable of this, then what about Lucia and Dienne...\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Not only Lucia, but Dienne also possessed a talent with the modifier \"genius.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>With talents ranging from dull, general, water, talented, genius, I couldn\\'t even imagine what kind of monsters they were.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Well, Lucia is perfect even if she\\'s lazy.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>According to the settings, Dienne was a character who even put in effort.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In the game, there were limits to growth because it was just a graphic, but I suddenly became curious about how strong living characters who made judgments and breathed would become.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Perhaps they could become stronger than when I raised them...</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Anyway, now is the time to celebrate with the potions I have made.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Actually, regeneration and recovery potions already existed in this world.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>However, the modifiers that followed were \"inferior,\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>and there were only those with side effects.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>What I made was an \"inferior\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>potion that had the same efficacy but no side effects.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Intermediate or advanced is beyond my level.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As my talent evolved, I felt it more clearly.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Before, I vaguely expected that it might work, but now I could clearly perceive that I couldn\\'t make them.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Just the intermediate regeneration potion required more than twenty ingredients, so I couldn\\'t even guess how long it would take to find the right combination.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>For now, I have to be satisfied with the inferior ones.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Taking advantage of my success, I continued to make potions as if they were being produced in a factory.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Even if I used one per day, I would need 365 in a year.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And since each one was different, I had to multiply it by 3 for three types of potions.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Moreover, unlike other potions, the more recovery potions there were, the more they helped with fatigue recovery, so it was advantageous to have more.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Bahart Inspiration, I will eat well!\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Since it wasn\\'t my money, I had no hesitation in using the ingredients.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was truly the optimal conditions and environment.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Because I didn\\'t expect to succeed so quickly, I made potions in large quantities with the materials I bought for experimentation.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I even skipped meals and focused on production for four hours.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Time is always the issue.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>While I was making them, an alarm rang inside the laboratory.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It was the alarm to leave.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Before I knew it, it was time to go out, so I reluctantly tidied up.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Still, I felt relieved because I had made a total of 10 regeneration and recovery potions each.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I\\'m full even without eating.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Yeah.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I let out an unpleasant laugh and looked at the potions in my backpack.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Even though I hadn\\'t eaten, looking at the potions made me feel full.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Now, the real journey begins.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The first step of endless training has finally begun.</p>\\n  </body>\\n</html>\\n'\n",

might not be satisfied with my swordsmanship, from my perspective, it was an incredible achievement considering I had only been training for a little over a month.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIt was the third week since I started using recovery and regeneration potions.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI could clearly feel the effects of the potions and I was putting in effort into my training every day.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAnd during my training, I gained an astonishing ability.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n[Adrias Cromwell]</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>- Human\\n- Mana: 1620\\n- Special

<p>\\nAnd not just any talent, but an extraordinary talent.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"I never expected something like this to happen.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAbout a week ago, while I was learning swordsmanship from Nickel through potion absorption, something unexpected happened.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIt wasn\\'t a significant achievement or accomplishment.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n- Ting!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n[As a result of endless effort, a part of Kim Jin-hwan\\'s talent has been inherited.]</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>[Talent \\'Physical Exercise (Prodigy)\\' has been acquired.]</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nSuddenly, a screen appeared and blocked my view during my training.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAnd after confirming the contents, I couldn\\'t help but be surprised.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nFirst of all, there was nothing to pick apart about the talent, from its content to its grade.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\\'Physical Exercise.\\'\\n\\nIt was an A-grade talent.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThe shorter the content of a talent, the better.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIf it was something like \\'Physical Exercise - Running,\\' it would be a C-grade talent.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"I knew I had talents from my previous life, but seeing it firsthand, it feels like an incredible ability.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nEven though I had realized that there was a significant gap in talents that evolved through the evolution of potion crafting talents, I never expected to have an extraordinary talent like this.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nWell, I had to have such abilities to survive in the military.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI didn\\'t just safely complete my military service without any disabilities.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThanks to inheriting the talent, my swordsmanship skills improved drastically.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nEven though it had only been three weeks since I started using potions, I was able to wield the sword quite convincingly.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"Now, I just need to awaken my new mana...\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThose who have already awakened their mana diverged in their paths depending on where they awakened their mana.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThose who learn magic have a mana storage in their hearts, while knights have a storage under their belly button called the \"Dahnjeon.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nOnce the location of the storage is determined, there is no way to change it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nBut I had the special ability of a dual core.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"I can use both magic and the sword.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nOf course, I wasn\\'t the only one with this possibility.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>There were individuals who were born with the probability of being able to use both, similar to a mutation.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nHowever, most of those who possessed such possibilities died without even knowing that they had a unique physique, as they focused on mastering only one of the abilities.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nIn a world where it was questionable whether one could focus on just one ability, trying to do both was considered unusual.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nOnly those who already knew or those with empty heads like me would attempt it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nAnyway, now I just had to add a little more and the Dahnjeon would be formed.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"I should stop here for today.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI finished my training earlier than usual.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThen, Nickel approached me, swaying his head as he spoke.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n\"There\\'s a mid-term evaluation tomorrow.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I don\\'t know what the test will be, but you should take it easy for a bit.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nWhile other majors had evaluations next week, the Combat Magic major was the first to announce their evaluation for tomorrow.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nI didn\\'t know what I would be doing in the Knight Department, but I hoped it would be a straightforward task.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\n*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>*</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\nThe grounds of the Rodren Academy were so massive that the word \"huge\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>was an understatement.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>First of all, in the east, there was the Monas Academy, which was a subsidiary academy and a lower rank of the Rodelren Academy, and it had a total of 1,000 students.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>There was a need for living and educational spaces for over 1,000 students, as well as various facilities such as training grounds, sparring grounds, research buildings, collection buildings, and breeding facilities.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>And in the main Rodelren Academy, there were facilities nearly ten times the size of Monas.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>There were not only educational and living spaces, but also entertainment spaces and various ecosystems, from the forest where life thrived to the secret grounds of the Rodelren Matap that could only be accessed within the academy through a mini mana train.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Because it was such a large place, the physical distance between the Knight Department and the Magic Department, even though they were in the same academy, couldn\\'t help but be far apart.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The only opportunity for interaction was during the time when there were no classes, visiting living spaces and entertainment spaces.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Haah.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Yuuri watched Dienne breathe out a sigh, her face flushed like a girl lost in a dream.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Is it really that great to go to the Knight Department?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Huh?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>No, I\\'m not really...?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Wipe your drool and then talk.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Yuuri stuck out her tongue as she spoke, watching Dienne.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Dienne quickly wiped her mouth in a hurry.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I was kidding.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Do you really believe that?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"You\\'re mean.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"You should have seen your expression just now.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It looked like you were really drooling.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Dienne turned her gaze out the window of the mana train, pretending to be annoyed, and Yuuri apologized while reaching out her hand.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>In the end, the sight of Dienne bursting into laughter made the male students who were in the same compartment admire and glance at her.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Ah, speaking of the Knight Department, didn\\'t Carlos oppa say he\\'s coming to the year-end event this time?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yeah, he\\'s definitely coming this time.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Oh, Dienne, you\\'re so lucky.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>You\\'ll get to see the face of the oppa you like so much after a long time.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"What are you talking about?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I don\\'t like that ogre.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Hehe.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Our Dienne is not honest.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Ugh.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I can\\'t hear you!\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Dienne covered her ears and shook her head, while Yuuri\\'s gaze turned to the back of a male student.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Dienne, Dienne.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"What now?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Have you heard the rumors lately?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"What rumors?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"They say a weird magician who exercises has appeared recently.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Why is exercising considered weird?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I exercise too.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Professor Tolman even said that as a magician, you should not only focus on research but also build up your physical strength through exercise so that you can avoid danger even in dire situations.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"No, I mean, he does exercises that are more like what knights do.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Really?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Well, if it\\'s enough to become a rumor, it must be quite something.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yeah.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>But do you know who the protagonist of that rumor is?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Dienne followed Yuuri\\'s gaze, pretending to be uninterested.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Adrias?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Ding dong!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Correct answer.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Ugh, just say it.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I\\'m not interested in him.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Hehe, even Dienne, the lover of all knights in the world, rejects him!\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"What are you talking about?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Why is he a knight?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Just because he exercises doesn\\'t mean everyone who exercises is a knight in this world.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Dienne grumbled, trying to sneak a peek at the book Adrias was reading.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Fortunately, there were several books piled up next to him.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\\'Basics of Magic, Definition and Understanding of Mana Arrangement, Utilization of Basic Spells?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Why is he reading those?\\' Her head tilted towards the basic books that were even covered at the Monas Academy.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It seemed a bit difficult last time, but what\\'s this about now?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Anyway, doesn\\'t he seem different?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"What?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Adrias?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I told you I\\'m not interested.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"No, maybe it\\'s because he exercises, but his body, his physique.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>At Yuuri\\'s words, Dienne\\'s gaze involuntarily turned back.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It did seem like her body had become a bit more muscular.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Of course, she wouldn\\'t have noticed if she hadn\\'t heard that he was exercising.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Besides, she was wearing a robe for magic users, so her body shape wasn\\'t clearly visible.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"If you\\'re so interested, why don\\'t you confess to him?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Me?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>With Adrias?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Haha, ahahaha!\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Dienne burst into laughter suddenly, and all the students on the train looked at Yuuri.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Dienne felt embarrassed, but she pretended to be nonchalant and haughty, looking out the window with grace.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Ah, ah.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I\\'m sorry.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I suddenly had a funny thought and laughed by myself.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Yurihi, who was looking out the window, called out to Dienne, apologizing clumsily.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Dienne looked at her as if asking when she had looked out the window, and casually adjusted her posture.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Dienne, I didn\\'t know you could make jokes like that.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"It\\'s not a joke.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If you\\'re interested, date me.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Our academy always supports healthy relationships.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Ah, who would ruin someone\\'s love life?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>If rumors spread that I\\'m dating Adrias, my life as a woman would be over.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"But still, look at that.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>She seems to be living diligently even now, reading books.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Maybe she has matured as you said.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Sorry, Dienne.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I won\\'t tease you anymore.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Please don\\'t involve me with Adrias.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>At that moment, the announcement sound indicating the arrival of the Mana train rang out.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"This station is Auckland Training Ground Station.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After a 3-minute stop, the train will depart for the next station, Rios Dormitory.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>After the announcement ended, Professor Tolman, who was sitting in the front seat, stood up.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Please prepare to disembark.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>We have arrived.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>As soon as he finished speaking, a strange atmosphere began to fill the train.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The students stiffened their expressions and tensed their bodies as if they were preparing for a battle.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Oh, the atmosphere is intense, isn\\'t it?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I guess so.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Knight and mage.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The question of who is stronger between the two has been a topic since the beginning of this world\\'s history.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Since becoming a mage was more difficult in terms of talent, mages had an unconscious sense of privilege, while knights looked down on mages who didn\\'t have physical prowess.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Their rivalry was quite remarkable due to the tendency of mutual disregard, which became a reason for factions to form not only in the academy but also in society, and the beginning of power struggles.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Finally, as the train came to a stop and the doors opened, the 3rd-year students of the Department of Magic led by Professor Tolman began to disembark.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The knight students had already gathered there, emitting a tremendous force as if they were about to engage in battle.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The professor who led the knight department showed no intention of stopping them and watched the approaching Department of Magic with a haughty expression.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>That\\'s when it happened.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Haha!</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Tolman, how have you been?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Your Highness Cloche!\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>An unexpected figure came out from between the knight students, waving his hand.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The Department of Magic students, including Professor Tolman, were taken aback and hurriedly approached him.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>A man with red hair spreading in all directions like a beast, with a bulky physique, shook Tolman\\'s hand and patted his shoulder.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Long time no see, Tolman.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It\\'s been almost a year!\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Your Highness, I hope you have been well?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Of course.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>You look healthy too, thankfully.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The Department of Magic students, even Dienne, the daughter of the Duke, couldn\\'t hide their surprise as they looked at him.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Even though the rivalry between mages and knights was fierce, there were few mages who dared to ignore a master like him.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"But why are you here...?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Oh, I came to meet someone for a moment.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>I finished my business and was thinking of seeing Alven Inspiration while I was here, and coincidentally, I heard that you were coming here, so I waited.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"I see.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>It\\'s nice to see you after a long time.\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Just as the conversation was about to start, the gaze of Duke Cloche fell on someone.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Hmm?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>He hesitated for a moment, then started approaching the person he was looking at.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>The students couldn\\'t hide their curiosity as they watched him approach the student standing where he stopped.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Why him?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Isn\\'t it Dienne Alven, the daughter of Bahat Alven?</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Knowing or not knowing the students\\' thoughts, Duke Cloche, the Duke of Mu\\'an (\\xe6\\xad\\xa6\\xe5\\xae\\x89), smiled and asked.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Are you Adrias Cromwell?\"</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>Numerous gazes focused on Adrias, who received the question.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>People expected to see Adrias\\'s fierce reaction to the imposing Duke Cloche, who made them nervous just by approaching.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>However, contrary to their expectations, Adrias calmly looked up at the giant in front of him and replied.</p>\\n    <br/>\\n    <p>\"Yes, I am Adrias Cromwell.\"</p>\\n  </body>\\n</html>\\n'\n",
